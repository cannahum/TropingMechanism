Megamind: Your weakness is copper? You\'re kidding, right?\n\u2014 Megamind note\xa0He actually was kidding.\nBeing a Super Hero ain\'t easy. Most of the original Flying Bricks have the good Achilles heels covered, and the pharmacy is even out of Psycho Serum to give you a cheap Backstory gimmick to explain your powers.\nWhat\'s left for the modern hero and villain to do? Make do with a Weaksauce Weakness. It\'s great for comedic effect, but just as often it ends up being an Achilles\' Heel that makes your average Mundane Solution seem perfectly reasonable by comparison.\nThe weakness isn\'t a common household cleaning agent like Mundane Solution, but something so incredibly, stupidly embarrassing you\'d think the Super Hero would never use his power out of shame in the off chance someone found out about it, or because it shows up regularly in the course of their super heroing. The "weakness" might come in the form of the fuel for the super power, a humiliating Transformation Sequence or activation phrase, an Embarrassing but Empowering Outfit, or just a set of restrictions on the powers that really are begging to get laughed at. Therefore, this is one of the most popular ways to Bless your hero With Suck.\nIf the weakness is a Logical Weakness, it can be pulled off. If not, it can seriously stress the Willing Suspension of Disbelief, unless it\'s Played for Laughs.\nEspecially cruel writers will have clever villains make it a Weaponized Weakness. However, a Kryptonite-Proof Suit can even the odds.\nThis is also commonly exploited in an Easily Thwarted Alien Invasion, where Bizarre Alien Biology is probably to blame.\nSubtropes include:\n Cannot Cross Running Water\n Can\'t Use Stairs\n Cold Iron (depending on the definition of "cold")\n Salt Solution\n Super Drowning Skills\n Vampires Hate Garlic\n Verbal Weakness\n Weakened by the Light\nRelated to Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?. See also Kryptonite Factor. If played for laughs, the one so harmed may Fight Off the Kryptonite. In extreme cases, the character will defend themselves from the weakness with a Cross-Melting Aura. For the inversion, of being at risk from a lack of something, see Phlebotinum Dependence.\n\nExamples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime & Manga\xa0\n Tobor, the 8th Man, recharged his powers with an inhalant stored in small, thin, white tubes that he carried in a cigarette case. When the bad guys allowed him "one last smoke" before executing him, this was great; when he was having a fight where kids could see him, he worried about setting a bad example by appearing to smoke.\n JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure:\n Vampires are seen as nearly invincible gods among men...unless the sun is out. Or you punch them with sunlight-infused martial arts. Or you hit them really hard in the brain and screw up their ability to control their own bodily functions (though not many beings out there aren\'t immune to that). Or just have a Pillar Man (essentially super vampires) so much as touch them, which will cause them to be instantly absorbed.\n Pillar Men also have a weakness to the sun and Hamon, but due to their biology (and possibly Kars\'/Cars\' stone masks) they can turn themselves into something similar to stone blocking off UV rays. When Kars becomes the Ultimate Lifeform, he loses his weakness to the sun among other benefits.\n In Slayers, female spell-casters have a very common and mundane weakness: menstruation. During a woman\'s menstruation period, her magical power output drops tremendously, so much so that even the protagonist, Lina Inverse, who is one of the strongest sorceresses in the entire Slayers setting, is barely able to cast a novice Light spell during her period. This is apparently a well-known weakness, as Zelgadis and even Gourry both figure out why her powers are weakened at one point, though Gourry is so ignorant that he doesn\'t understand the significance of "that time of the month" and just assumes it\'s magic-related.\n One Piece:\n Anyone who\'s eaten a Devil Fruit gets amazing powers, but they all share one weakness; the inability to swim. At all. If they are so much as half-submerged in water of any kind, they become paralyzed (and for many, their powers stop working). Which is kind of a problem, seeing as how many of the encountered Devil Fruit users are pirates or marines in a world that\'s ninety percent ocean.\n Though this is more of a subversion in that this weakness very, very rarely becomes an issue, especially considering how many Devil Fruit users are in the series and how four of them are in the main cast. This is even lampshaded in the Enies Lobby arc; when two members of CP9 are trying to decide whether or not to eat Devil Fruits that had been provided to them, Rob Lucci mentions that being unable to swim isn\'t much of a problem(then again, all members of CP9 have the ability to Double Jump, so there\'s that).\n Depending on the situation, basic hypnosis (such as Jango\'s ring or Ms. Goldenweek\'s emotion-altering paint) serves as one of the weaknesses for Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist. Due to his simple-minded nature, he just won\'t have the sense to turn away, which makes him helpless and left to the devices of his enemies.\n Water is actually a much greater weakness to Sir Crocodile, as he is a man who can turn into sand; if water strikes him, the sand "sticks together," and he is rendered unable to turn into sand at all, thus leaving him fully open to attack. He has a natural defense in that his sand powers extend to causing alarmingly fast dehydration with direct skin contact. In addition, he has the good sense to not only do his villainous business on a relatively large island, but on a desert island. He also uses Dance Powder to not only to frame the king in an effort to overthrow him, but also to stop it from raining in the town he was using as a base. In addition, on the off-chance that someone was able to negate his logia defense for a significant period time (like with Luffy), he\'s skilled in other combat arts as well. His hook has a second, poisoned hook under it, and if that hook gets broken, he can eject a knife in its place.\n In-universe, at least, we have Eneru. His Shock and Awe abilities are considered among the most godlike Devil Fruit powers in the setting, yet Luffy\'s relatively low-tier Rubber Man powers completely and utterly negated them, to the point that Eneru had to get really creative with his powers just to find a way to harm Luffy at all, and only his unrelated Spider-Sense ability protected him from getting beaten to a pulp pretty much instantly.\n Blackbeard has one of the most powerful abilities in universe. He can wipe out entire towns in seconds, shoot the debris out like cannon, and negate Devil Fruit powers. But he can\'t dodge anything. While most Logia-fruit users can have attacks pass right through them, Blackbeard is quite the opposite, making any physical attack super-effective. Basically increased pain without the ability to die, like getting stabbed with fire.\n The specialists, the Paper Sisters in Read or Dream can telekinetically manipulate paper... unless it\'s wet. This was not a weakness for Yomiko Readman, who is shown on camera manipulating paper while underwater. This is actually explained in-universe. The Paper Sisters\' powers are essentially imperfect clones of Yomiko\'s, artificially created by Dokusensha; which is why they are weaker and more specialized/limited. Water naturally disrupts the structural integrity of paper, and their inferior powers are not sufficient to maintain it the way Yomiko can.\n Macross:\n Super Dimension Fortress Macross has an alien attack force made up of gigantic Scary Dogmatic Aliens who are a proud warrior race do a mass Mook\x96Face Turn because of... singing. And souvenirs. In fairness, it does make sense in the story (at least as much as The War of the Worlds Martians being vulnerable to Earth\'s diseases) and is perhaps one of the best logical conclusions to a typical alien\'s Planet of Hats treatment. The Zentradi have no culture to speak of other than fighting, so when exposed to humans and their culture in the form of songs and interacting with the other gender after sending a team of spies to the SDF-1, typical Zentradi start feeling emotions, questioning their purpose, and becoming similar to humans. Because of this, their entire fleet gets deemed "contaminated" by the unexposed Zentradi and programmed for destruction. In the face of this Enemy Civil War, they wisely choose to ally with the humans. Still, it doesn\'t quite wash away the faint air of ridiculousness when Minmay\'s singing becomes an offensive weapon to unbalance the unexposed Zentradi in their attack.\n Those who consider Minmei The Scrappy half-jokingly argue the Zentraedi were distracted by her singing because it was so bad in the Robotech dub.\n The initial use of Minmay\'s voice as a weapon is actually short-lived: while the Zentradi were initially too distracted to react, as soon as the heroes opened fire they started firing back. The real decisive weapon in that engagement was Minmei kissing Kaifun: the Zentradi were so disgusted they stopped fighting effectively, trying absolutely anything to erase the image from their minds, including firing in the middle of nowhere (a Zentradi heavy cruiser was observed doing exactly this as Hikaru locked his nukes on it) and listening to Minmei\'s songs.\n Taken to even greater extremes in Macross 7 where the spirit draining Protodevilns\'s only weakness is actually the energy produced by music. It produces a spiritual energy "too pure for them to absorb" and regenerates the lost energy in those drained by them.\n In one humorous scene, a Protodeviln gets a "brilliant idea" for shielding himself against the humans\' singing. He puts on earplugs. This actually does work, but Basara just plays even louder. Afterward the Protodeviln installed a noise canceller in his mech, which proved much more effective.\n Incidentally, one OVA shows us that Minmei\'s registered songs have absolutely no effect on unexposed Meltrandi (the FEMALE Zentradi), who just ignore them (partly because they had the common sense to just jam the frequencies used to broadcast them), but BASARA\'s songs made them groupies the very moment he managed to get them to hear him. It baffled a UN Spacy higher-up, who had assumed the Meltrandi would just jam the broadcast (both times the Minmei tactic had been seen used had been with broadcasts the enemy didn\'t jam for one reason or another).\n In Rosario + Vampire, vampires are considered the high end of the monster scale, but the fact that you can take a vampire down with a glass of water kinda puts a dampener on that idea. Though, you\'d have to be of werewolf speed to even consider hitting them with the stuff in the first place. Vampires are ironically said to have the most weaknesses compared to any other monster. Things like silver would also do them in.\n Ranma \xbd:\n The titular hero(ine) can be incapacitated by the mere sight of a cute little kitten. However, those who attempt this should note to apply said weakness quickly and forcefully \u2014 prolonged, intense exposure has a tendency to backfire. Thanks to his Gender Bender curse, cold water can also count as a weakness. Technically. Ranma\'s female form has less strength and reach than his male form (though the anime is explicit that Ranma\'s speed is boosted in this form, so it\'s more of a trade), but s/he can still pull off all of his/her normal attacks. Based on a character with an identical curse, it\'s also possible that being in female form weakens his Ki Attacks.\n His fiancee Shampoo and his main rival Ryoga Hibiki have an even worse case of the water weakness than Ranma does; Jusenkyo made them become a little kitten and miniature pig respectively when splashed with cold water. So they go from incredibly powerful fighters to harmless little animals whose only recourse is to run or hide until they can get some hot water. Genma Saotome, Ranma\'s father, subverts it; his panda form loses little, if any, speed and agility while gaining in strength and toughness due to the increased bulk. Mousse, meanwhile, seesaws between subverting this trope and playing it straight with his duck curse; while it is much smaller, weaker and can\'t use his physical attacks, it can fly and he\'s still capable of throwing barrages of knives, darts and bombs in it.\n And a non-water version applies to Happosai, who is such a Dirty Old Man that his perversion becomes his own Achilles heel. If there is a fight serious enough, or a reward great enough, that he can\'t be immediately distracted from whatever he was doing by the sight of girls in skimpy clothing, bare cleavage or a bra, it hasn\'t come up in the series. He can even be lured right into dangers simply by tossing a bra in the right place.\n Spoiled prince Saffron has incredible fire magic powers, the ability to fly and regenerate so fast that he can tear off his own wings to use as throwing weapons and grow them back in seconds, but because of his lax and pampered upbringing he can\'t take any sort of physical blow and in a world full of martial artists that\'s a big problem\n From Cromartie High School:\n My name is Yutaka Takenouchi, and I have only one weakness ... I am very susceptible to motion sickness!\n Fairy Tail:\n Natsu is Made of Iron, he can breathe fire and cause massive property damage simply by punching someone, but he too suffers from the ignominious susceptibility to transportation. At least once it was actually exploited to defeat him in battle. This motion sickness seems to extend to being carried by people, as well. He\'s perfectly fine being taken to flight by Happy the cat, however, reasoning that Happy isn\'t a vehicle. According to Rogue, all Dragon Slayers suffer from this.\n Wendy however, doesn\'t suffer from transportation. Rather, She\'s weak to pickled plums.  After the 1-year timeskip, she started to suffer from transportation.\n Gajeel, similarly only began suffering from motion sickness after joining Fairy Tail. It\'s never explained why it never bothered him before, only that eventually all Dragon Slayers gain this weakness.\n In Bleach, Espada #9 Aaroniero can\'t use his shapeshifting when in sunlight. Though he can still use any of his other 30,000+ powers (not that he does before getting killed, but he had the option). To make matters worse, he lives in Hueco Mundo, which has no natural sun. His boss builds a fake one for no discernible reason.\n Fullmetal Alchemist:\n In the manga and second anime, Pride can project razor-sharp tentacle-like shadows from his body. But he can only project them where ordinary shadows could be cast; complete darkness renders him unable to attack and bright lights can cut off his tentacles. Granted, he is still near immortal even when he can\'t attack; in a way he is both the most powerful and the most vulnerable homunculus.\n A common mistake for people in the series is to assume that Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang is useless when wet (or without his gloves). This is only true to a certain extent (he\'s arguably more dangerous with lots of water around so long as he has an alternative method of creating a spark, as he can spit the water into hydrogen and oxygen and then ignite it...the problem is that unless he can trap the target in an enclosed area with the water he\'s liable to blow up any nearby allies and himself at the same time, hence this technique being very rarely used), and let\'s just say he earned his rank.\n A combination of this and Berserk Button: Insulting Ed\'s height, while entertaining, has a tendency to impair his judgement as he blindly charges the enemy. This is mostly Played for Laughs, although Pride uses it once to get an edge in combat.\n Pride: Appearances can often be deceiving. Isn\'t that right, little alchemist?\n Ed: Grk!\n *Pride attacks*\n In Naruto, Konan of the Akatsuki is, like all members of that group, very powerful. Yet her paper-based techniques can be completely nullified by spraying oil on her to make her stick together (a technique one human ninja and some summoned toads have), although water can release her.\n Adam Blade from NEEDLESS has a weakness for little girls, and usually ended up getting his butt kicked because of this. Though later in the manga his weakness had developed from mere lolis to naked lolis. On the other hand, his love for lolis can temporally boost his strength and saves him from a Lotus-Eater Machine, so it\'s subverted.\n Emperor Nightmare, the leader of Nightmare Enterprises (Holy Nightmare Co. in the Japanese version) in Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, is weak against AND afraid of one weapon that Kirby can take control of by swallowing his Warp Star: the Star Rod.\nNightmare: Aaaah! How did Kirby discover the secret?! That pitiful little Star Warrior has found my only weakness! I am helpless against the power of the Star Rod! WAAAAUUUUGGGGHHH!!!!\n The Dai Gurren in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a walking battleship... that is not designed to go on water. A battleship that isn\'t designed to go on water.\n In one episode of Myriad Colors Phantom World, the team are pitted against a Youkai Phantom in the form of a sunflower. They can\'t beat him until Koito works out that because he\'s a sunflower, he can only face towards the sun. They therefore defeat him by simply walking round him and attacking from behind, where he can\'t see or reach them.\n In Ah! My Goddess, Urd is put to sleep by Enka music, traditional Japanese ballads. When someone tries to take advantage of this fact, she just pops in earplugs.\n Mara is weak to rock music; it causes her to dance uncontrollably.\n Dragon Ball:\n The only way to defeat Chaozu\'s psychic attacks is to break his concentration. Krillin does this by asking him extremely difficult math questions. Like 9 - 1. After that his teacher the Crane Hermit immediately gave him remedial math lessons.\n Apparently, whistling around Piccolo, or any Namek can really incapacitate them. This becomes a plot point in the DBZ movie Lord Slug where Piccolo  asks Gohan to start whistling after ripping off his own ears in a desperate attempt to stop Lord Slug.\n In the Otherworld Tournament filler, Goku shows that he\'s exceptionally vulnerable to being tickled given that Caterpy is able to hold Goku in place and torture him for several minutes despite Goku being many times stronger than him without becoming a Super Saiyan.\n In each of their respective Non-Serial Movie appearances, the embodiments of evil Hirudegarn and Janemba become defenseless when enraged/insulted.\n In Fukashigi Philia, the villain Shidow is extremely fearful towards water to the point if he gets in contact with it, he will go berserk and have his abilities neutralized.\n All of the Abilities Users created by Noa and Isumi have a particular weakness - it\'s usually whatever originally killed them (such as water for Shidow, who drowned, or dry ice for another, who froze to death).\n From Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple, we have Akisame Koetsuji, the Jujutsu Philosopher. Master martial artist, a doctor so skilled he can raise the recently dead, and master of a bazillion and six other fields. He\'s one of Kenichi\'s six super-powerful masters... and green peppers make him so ill that he can be held at bay simply by hanging one outside his door.\n Kinnikuman is weakened by milk. Though after he goes insane during his match against Curry Cook and drinks the stuff, it becomes apparent that he just thinks it\'s disgusting.\n Fairies from Humanity Has Declined are killed by EM waves, a.k.a. light, the most ubiquitous thing in the universe. If the setting wasn\'t After the End they\'d be screwed. And they still have problems with it anyway.\n Shiina from Angel Beats! is Ranma turned Up to Eleven: a ridiculously hypercompetent ninja, but when she sees a puppy about to go over a waterfall she instinctively does a Stupid Sacrifice, getting them both killed...and it was a stuffed puppy. The puppy trap was actually meant for Angel, so it\'s possible she has the same weakness.\n Italy from Axis Powers Hetalia can run insanely fast, and  defeated the Ottoman Empire, which was pretty powerful at the time, while he was only a child. According to the author, the only thing keeping him from dominating Europe is that he\'s just too afraid to.\n Shiina in Gourmet Girl Graffiti absolutely can\'t be splashed by rain; any amount would make her instantly sick for a whole week. This is why she was wearing a whole hazmat gear when she\'s "risking it" to the cram school in chapter 6/episode 4. Dishwater apparently does the same thing, as seen in episode 7.\n In Cowboy Bebop, Pierrot le Fou a.k.a. Tongpu is a psychotic, unstoppable, bulletproof Psychopathic Manchild. He has exactly two weaknesses, both psychological: A pathological fear of cats due to the experiments that he was subjected to, and  feeling pain, induced in this case by Spike hurling a knife (a projectile too slow to be stopped by Pierrot\'s experimental shield) into his thigh.\n In Kobayashisan Chi No Maid Dragon Tooru mentioned that her friend Herensuge was beaten to death by an egg without a yolk. This is actually a reference to the legend that Herensuge could be killed by cracking an egg on its head.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comedy\xa0\n One of ventriloquist Jeff Dunham\'s puppets is a goofy superhero wannabe named Melvin, who has no realistic powers to speak of, but is enthusiastic about it. He also has not one, but two weaknesses: cupcakes and porn \u2014 though not both at the same time, however, because he needs a free hand.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comic Books\xa0\n Almost every Green Lantern from The Silver Age of Comic Books onward had yellow as his main weakness. Any criminal could waltz past him by wearing a yellow suit and stealing only gold, and shoot yellow painted bullets from gold plated guns. That being said, a clever person could find a way around it. Such as using the ring to pick up something not made of yellow, and hitting the criminal with it. There have been various explanations such as programming bugs or a deliberately-induced Fantastic Fragility, but the currently-accepted explanation is a combination of yellow representing fear, the enemy of the Heroic Willpower energy the Lanterns wield, and the fact that a yellow fear monster had been imprisoned in the Central Battery, tainting the power source. The weakness can now be recognized and overcome, and adaptations tend to downplay it into almost nothing.\n Frank Miller parodied this in All-Star Batman & Robin, the Boy Wonder. Before confronting Green Lantern, Batman and Robin paint a house, and everything in it, yellow. Then they put on yellow costumes. Then they paint their exposed faces yellow. When GL comes over, Batman goes so far as to offer him a nice refreshing glass of lemonade, while Robin eats some lemon ice cream. Hal was not amused. Readers were.\n The original Green Lantern was almost as bad \u2014 his weakness was wood. Since so few people knew it as later Green Lanterns became famous, however, he in many cases seemed more powerful than the new Green Lanterns because, for example, the Sinestro Corps yellow power rings couldn\'t even make him flinch.\n This was parodied in the Justice League Golden Age Affectionate Parody episode "Legends", with his stand-in version "Green Guardsman", who had a weakness to aluminum. Either way, you\'ve got a superhero who could appear on the news after having been beaten to death with a baseball bat \u2014 and considering that one of his foes was the Sportsmaster, who did wield a baseball bat... it\'s pretty darned weaksauce.\n It didn\'t hurt that wood, while very common when Alan Scott first hit the scene, had become rarer in civilization by the time The Silver Age of Comic Books hit. Villains in The DCU tend to decorate in metal, plastic, and Zee Rust by then, which means even less to block that strange ring with.\n This actually becomes a problem for him in the Elseworlds story Kingdom Come. Like most of the other original heroes, Green Lantern Alan Scott\'s powers have progressed to a ludicrous level - he keeps watch over the Earth in a massive emerald Space Station, constructed himself a suit of impressive armor, and carries around a sword made out of pure energy - all from his power ring. None of it helps very much against Green Arrow in the final battle, since this Oliver Queen\'s arrows are made out of wood.\n This was the main reason that Solomon Grundy was such a threat to Alan. Being drowned, soaked in and resurrected in a swamp, his body was filled and covered with plant matter, rendering the ring all but useless in directly affecting Grundy (Swamp Thing even explained that Solomon Grundy was now a plant-based elemental of sorts like he was).\n The Elseworlds story Superman & Batman: Generations Handwaves the odd Green Lantern weaknesses by having the Guardians explain that all weaknesses are mentally-imposed. Alan was weak to wood because a thug surprised him with a baseball bat and he assumed the ring didn\'t work against wood, while Hal was told that the rings were ineffective against yellow and thus added the weakness himself. Kyle, who gets his ring without hearing the explanation, lacks any weaknesses. (This is not, to be clear, how it actually works in continuity.)\n Another story, detailing the ring\'s story and Alan Scott\'s backstory (for readers in The \'90s, at least), the guardians, in a long story involving one of Earth\'s first Green Lanterns, retcon the weakness. Because he was almost killed by a yellow monster, the weakness was removed from his ring. He became mad with power, so the Guardians gave him the wood weakness so primitive humans could club him to death. However, instead of dying, he put his soul into the power ring and battery, which collided with a Meteorite, becoming the Starheart. Alan Scott got his ring from the Starheart. Seriously.\n One Green Lantern story subverts this, however. A yellow robot attacks the Justice League. GL responds by picking up mud from a nearby swamp and dropping it over the robot\'s body, completely coating it. With the yellow hidden, he quite easily rips it open.\n The yellow weakness was especially weaksauce in The Silver Age of Comic Books because of the fact that every other villain seemed to emit some kind of "infra-yellow radiation", contain a "yellow compound", be surrounded by "invisible yellow" or have some other completely ridiculous piece of pseudoscience in place to stop Green Lantern destroying them in five seconds flat. For those curious: "infra-yellow", in a sane world, translates as  orange.\n This was a very situational weakness, as sometimes Hal\'s constructs interacted with Sinestro\'s yellow ones, creating a blue haze that negated both. Other times, Lanterns responded by using variations of Car Fu with whatever they could throw at an opponent, or even remembering that an opaque construct around a target meant only green light got through \u2014 and turning any yellow inside the construct into green due to reflective properties of the color yellow.\n And then there\'s the Blue Lanterns, who are incredibly powerful even by Green Lantern standards, but can\'t use anything but the bare minimum of their powers unless a Green Lantern is in the vicinity.\n According to Word of God from Greg Weisman, Green Lanterns in Young Justice do not have a weakness to yellow and original Green Lantern Alan Scott did not have a weakness to wood either.\n The absurdity of the Silver Age and Golden Age GL weaknesses was lampshaded in an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold:\n Guy Gardner: You\'re supposed to be one of the most powerful Lanterns ever, but your ring is vulnerable to wood? What happens if a guy comes at you with a pointy stick?\n Alan Scott: The same thing that happens to you if he paints it yellow!\n The yellow weakness was used in a clever fashion in "Ganthet\'s Tale", a Green Lantern graphic novel by Larry Niven and John Byrne. Hal Jordan\'s opponent in this one was a renegade Guardian, who could wield Green Lantern energy himself. The solution was for Hal to fly away from the Guardian at near-light speed, and while flying fire a bolt of energy from his ring. By the time the energy bolt connected with the Guardian, it red-shifted, its visible light wavelengths compressing down the color scale, from green to yellow.\n Echo from Daredevil and New Avengers possesses photographic muscle reflexes which makes her nearly unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. She\'s also deaf, which means she is unable to hear her opponents. Daredevil takes advantage of this by fighting her in a locked, darkened room, rendering her helpless.\n One version of Ocean Master, Aquaman\'s arch nemesis, gets his powers from a magical trident he traded his soul for, and when he isn\'t holding it he feels intense pain. Even The Joker finds this funny:\n "Sounds like the deal of the century, Flipper! And everyone says I\'m the crazy-"\n In the earlier Aquaman comics, the King of the Sea himself, for all his prowess in the ocean, could not be out of the water for more than an hour or he\'d dry out and die. He probably got this from Namor the Sub-Mariner, whom he was initially a Captain Ersatz of. Aqualad has a less-extreme version of this weakness in Young Justice. There isn\'t any set time limit, but he succumbs to exhaustion and dehydration far quicker than his teammates after they get lost in the desert.\n Power Girl went through a single-issue Dork Age where she could be hurt by any "natural, unprocessed material", including the proverbial sticks and stones. This for a character who\'s on par with Superman. The negative reaction from readers caused it to never appear again. It was just that weak. During her JLE days she was also allergic to diet soda, causing fits of anger.\n Empowered is a self-admitted Fanservice exploration of this. The main character is a curvy babe who derives her powers from an extremely skintight suit, that\'s laughably easy to rip and weakens her powers when damaged. Her tendency to end up naked (or nearly so) makes her the laughing stock of the local superhero community. Her tendency to get Bound and Gagged while doing so makes her living Fetish Fuel.\n The suit\'s ability to be torn seems to fluctuate with Empowered\'s confidence level. Since she has zero self-confidence anyway and the regular humiliations related to her crappy suit only compound them, it is very rare that she has the confidence to use her powers properly. But when she does, she\'s a one-woman army.\n Emp doesn\'t get the distinction of the weakest-sauce weakness, either... That honor goes to The Lash, a supervillain with a debilitating phobia of fabric stores due to childhood trauma. (He likens it to being put in a sensory deprivation tank.) Also, while not a weakness per se, on two separate occasions a supervillain has shown themselves to be unable to tie a knot, which is a vital career skill in this setting.\n Think about it. Being the only villain in the world not being able to tie up the one superhero with a reputation for always ending up bound and gagged by the lowliest of thugs.\n The Daxamites in The DCU are almost exactly like Kryptonians when under a yellow sun. However, exposure to lead is fatal to them, even in trace amounts, and (especially true in the Silver Age) being moved away from lead doesn\'t cure them. Once the poison is in their system, it\'s not going anywhere. A notable instance of this example was when one of Superman\'s recurrent enemies/reluctant allies, Paragon, took out three Daxamites with a machine gun while they were distracted by their Jerk Ass A God Am I power trip.\n Brainiac 5 invented a cure for the lead weakness that\'s been given to both multiple heroic Daxamites and stolen several times by the villainous ones. Apparently dying by being in the mere presence of bullets makes a character less than credible.\n Martian Manhunter has a ridiculous amount of powers, yet he had weakness to fire, making it quite easy to disable him. This because he saw his entire family\u2014and species as a whole\u2014die in a psychic plague that manifested itself as fire. He then buried the bodies of everyone on the planet. This makes his pyrophobia a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. The first attempt to remove this weakness accidentally unlocked his Superpowered Evil Side. Though technically, it\'s not a weakness of fire, it\'s a fear of fire.\n\n Prism, a member of the X-Men villain group the Marauders, is a truly pitiful example that combines this trope with What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?. His mutant ability is that he is made of a crystal that can absorb and redirect light energy (like a prism) and is no more durable than glass. Yes, he is made of glass. His weaknesses include any sort of impact. Two of his four deaths (yes, he has died often) involve being thrown into a wall and being shattered by bullets.\n Thor used to have a debilitating weakness: If he let go of Mj\xf6lnir for more than a minute, he turned into doctor Don Blake, who has a crippled leg (and presumably an acid tongue and a dry wit), and Mj\xf6lnir turns into a walking stick. Basically, House. This was removed years ago, which now makes Thor virtually invulnerable.\n Perun from The Ultimates is essentially a Thor wannabe...without the superhuman strength most Asgardians possess. Despite having a powerful hammer similar to Mj\xf6lnir, Perun is killed after an enemy sneaks up on him and quietly snaps his neck.\n The greater the power, the weaker the sauce! Marvel\'s latest and most prominent Superman pastiche is The Sentry, a "golden guardian of good" who\'s as powerful as he lets himself be. However, he\'s also agoraphobic\u2014he can\'t stand being outside. If you also so much as remind him of his little Dark Side problem, he\'ll fly off to Saturn and cry. Or revert to human form. Or, if he\'s really unlucky, let the Void out\u2014and suddenly things will look a whole lot better for the bad guys.\n One fancomic actually has him carrying around his entire living room whenever he wants to go anywhere.\n Iron Man once defeated him by forwarding his mail, more or less.\n This was once parodied in the British comic, The Beano, in which the character Calamity James is rescued by a superhero and offers him a Jelly Baby by way of thanks. Guess what the hero\'s one weakness is!\n Mr. Mxyzptlk is so powerful that he has no natural weaknesses. To make his fights with Superman more challenging, he gives himself one. Which one does he choose? Saying his own name backwards.\n Used hilariously in the animated series, with an episode consisting of Superman using clever and creative ways of exploiting Mr. Mxyzptlk\'s "weakness", often without having to use any sort of super powers at all.\n Post-Crisis it\'s a self-imposed weakness. In the Silver Age and Bronze Age, it was a natural aspect of fifth dimensional beings that saying their own names backwards sent them home. In the Golden Age, anyone (human or imp) who said Mxyztplk\'s name backwards would end up in the Fifth Dimension... or the Fifth Dimension attached to Earth-2, anyway.\n Venom. Weaknesses? Fire and loud noise. At one point, he\'s defeated with nothing more than a lighter (which raises the question of why Spider-Man doesn\'t just carry a $1.98 Bic lighter with him at all times). This varies Depending on the Writer. Carnage shares some of the same weaknesses.\n Fan-favorite (yet sadly not used, ever) Toxin, Carnage\'s "child" however doesn\'t, what it does have is being very child like, (one point it refused to help it\'s host because he yelled at it.)\n All Symbiotes are vulnerable to intense heat and sound. The amount of their resistance varies depending on the Symbiote in question (Carnage\'s resistances dwarf Venom\'s) and, on a more meta-note, as mentioned Depending on the Writer.\n Though it\'s actually justified in that the symbiotes come from a world with no atmosphere, and thus have no natural resistance to extreme temperature or noise because they\'d never naturally encounter them. Even a few generations with them around and the weakness is bred away quickly.\n Perhaps in response to claims of how silly his weaknesses are, the Ultimate version of Venom lacks the vulnerability to fire and sound. Instead, the only real threat to him is electrocution.\n Marvel\'s Valkyrie, in her early Defender years, was unable to fight against any foe that was feminine, even if she was alien or a robot.\n Marvel\'s The Inhumans, genetic superhumans who have advanced technology and a civilization predating regular humans\' by millennia, are done in by... pollution and germs.\n The Darkness, phenomenal cosmic/demonic power. But can\'t operate under a 60 Watt light bulb.\n Static\'s nemesis Hot-Streak had the ability to conjure powerful fireballs which he could hurl at his opponents. The catch? His powers were friction-based, so he could only use them after running around (albeit at super-speed, which he possessed in his first appearance) and building up heat energy from his feet. Once Static realized this, he simply attacked from behind and immobilized Hot-Streak with metal fixtures from a playground, rendering him completely helpless.\n He was a much bigger threat in the cartoon adaptation precisely because the writers ditched the friction weakness.\n Static himself gets completely shorted out if he is hit with water while powered up. He doesn\'t have this weakness in the comics.\n The DCU also had Firestorm, whose weakness is organic materials. All of them. He can\'t affect them with his power, or he\'ll suffer painful consequences. So...he could be foiled by a stick. Or a leather wallet.\n The second Firestorm was once beaten because he published a scientific paper on how his own powers worked. And Lex Luthor read it. "Oh no" indeed.\n Firestorm needs to merge with someone in order to use his powers. If the merge happens too long, his powers eat his partner.\n In one of his appearances on Super Friends, he was rendered helpless after being sprayed with plant food. Even their version of Aquaman wasn\'t as lame.\n In Firestorm\'s case, his weakness was probably imposed to prevent the implications of his powers being used on living people and animals. Since Blackest Night eventually provided us with a very memorable example of just how scary his powers could actually be, maybe it was for the best that writers watered him down early on.\n Commentators both in-universe and out have pointed out that Firestorm\'s real weakness is being an idiot. He can simply turn the air around someone to steel, yet his infamously lame villains have included a powerless albino dwarf and a guy with a rope.\n The short-lived hero Gunfire had the power to turn anything into a gun by charging it with explosive energy. Anything (except, oddly enough, an actual gun). Enter the Hitman story where Tommy defeats a future version of Gunfire by causing him to turn his own ass into a living grenade. Good times were had by all.\n Although it\'s since been removed, Eclipso - DC\'s god of darkness - could be dispelled from his human host by a camera flash.\n Gladiator, Praetor of the Shi\'ar Imperial Guard. Strong enough to shatter planets. Able to fly at many times the speed of light. Can withstand the heat of a star or the blast of a supernova. Has Eye Beams of unimaginable heat, and they can see particles on a subatomic level. Truly a being of such infinite power can only be defeated by...making him feel bad about himself.\n Somewhat justified in that his powers are explicitly psionic/mental in nature. If he believes that they won\'t work or that he can\'t complete a task with them, they won\'t work and he won\'t be able to complete that task. This means you don\'t actually need a weapon powerful enough to beat him, only something which you can convince him is a weapon powerful enough to beat him, which Rocket Raccoon exploited.\n Alternatively, bringing anything to the table that can disrupt psionic powers works just as well, as Nova showed when he beat Xenith -another Strontian- in just one punch after messing up her psionic powers with a headbutt from his psionic-dampening helmet.\n Another parody\u2014Super-Ace, an alternate Ace Rimmer from a superhero universe appeared in one Red Dwarf Smegazine comic strip. While he had the full array of Flying Brick powers, his one weakness was ... human flesh. So an ordinary Mook could punch him.\n Storm, of the X-Men, has complete control of the weather: in practice it gives her flight, superspeed, and the command of electricity, water, cold, and wind. So what\'s her weakness? Claustrophobia. If a writer wants to take her out of a battle, all they need to do is drop some rubble on her\u2014and sometimes not even that much. In her early years, she had a Heroic BSOD when a villain only mentioned a word that made her think of enclosed spaces. (These days, trying to stick her in an enclosed space just makes her mad.)\n When he first appeared, Loki had one\u2014he couldn\'t use his powers when wet/in contact with water. Against Thor, who could easily make it rain. No wonder this is ignored now.\n The sword in, umm, The Sword grants whomever touches it serious Super Strength, enough Super Speed to run on water and deflect bullets, and a powerful healing ability that can close gaping chest wounds and reattach limbs. Unfortunately, these only last for as long as the user maintains physical contact. Put it down to eat a sandwich or go to the bathroom and you\'re mortal again. At one point, protagonist Dara drops in the middle of a super-strength high jump (a natural reaction to being shot) and suddenly finds she\'s not landing, she\'s falling. Worse, go too long without touching the sword and any injuries it healed come back all at once.\n The first story of the 2011 relaunch of Swamp Thing features a kid villain named William Arcane. William\'s connection to the forces of Death (or The Rot) allow him to control all dead or decaying matter. This gives him immense power. The only problem is his fatal allergy to chlorophyll.\n "The Day Red Turned to Green", in Tales of the Unexpected #85 features giant mushroom-like aliens that can be harmed by anything red. The main character finds one of their "absorbo-sponges" while spelunking and anything red that he passes while carrying it turns green.\n Billy Batson/Captain Marvel says "Shazam!," the name of the wizard who granted him his powers, to change between his hero and civilian forms. This isn\'t really that bad, but his friend Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr. has to say "Captain Marvel!" to transform\u2014meaning that he not only has to be careful talking to Billy, but he can\'t even tell people his own code name without becoming powerless. He started going by "CM3" to fix this.\n In the first Titans Tomorrow storyline (which featured evil future versions of the Teen Titans), CM3 can also be depowered when a recording of his voice says "Captain Marvel!". This is played dead straight, as Batman (Tim Drake) uses a recording of CM3 revealing his secret identity to Tim to shut him down before CM3 can beat him into the ground.\n Pick someone, hero, villain, or somewhere in between with electricity based powers, chances are their weaknesses are, among other things, rubber and water.\n Speaking of Superman, a cover of an underground comix subverted this trope for laughs. You see loads of bullets bouncing off him harmlessly...and a custard pie volley. Granted, it doesn\'t hurt him either...but his pride.\n In The Umbrella Academy, Seance\'s powers only work when he\'s barefoot. He apparently collects shoes.\n The best weapon to defeat Wilq are lame jokes, or lame words in general. He does whatever he can to prevent the villains from learning about this.\n Wilq manages to disperse a leftist demonstration against the U.S. foreign policy by reading a few basic English sentences through a megaphone, finishing with throwing a hamburger sandwich at them.\n Transformers:\n The Transformers G1 comic introduced the Scraplets, a race of small, mechanical pests that corroded any Transformers they infected. They can be defeated only by the "rare and legendary fluid" called water.\n When it comes to weak weaknesses, you probably can\'t get any worse than Whirl from The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye. As an empurata victim Whirl, despite being a former Wrecker and powerful fighter, was stopped completely in his tracks by an unlocked door simply because it had to be opened with doorhandles that his claws couldn\'t grasp. Cyclonus had to turn the handles for him.\n Thanks to his adamantium skeleton, Wolverine cannot swim at all, causing him to just sink to the bottom.\n Eclipso\'s weakness during the Silver Age was blinding light, which would give control back to Bruce Gordon.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n How do you defeat your own author? Well, if you\'re a character in You Got HaruhiRolled!, just show him a disgusting Doujinshi. He\'ll be so Squicked out that he will be unable to resist you forcing him back through the dimensional portal whence he came.\n In Queen of All Oni, a Jackie Chan Adventures fanfic, Jade gains the weakness to onions Oni have in canon after EATING an Oni mask.\n Because he is a Living Shadow, Mysterious from My Little Unicorn gets hurt by standing in any form of light.\n In Christian Humber Reloaded, Vash, a God-Mode Sue with countless superpowers, multiple super modes, and an arsenal of high-tech and legendary weapons, who can take on entire armies and the main villains of several works of fiction without breaking a sweat, is vulnerable to Paralysis, a Useless Useful Spell in RPGs that rarely affects anything stronger than a common enemy.\n When the Discworld had a brief and potentially deadly meeting with the Alien Queen, a very improbable Ripley - albeit one working for the Guild of Assassins - realised that a lifeform based on very strong acids could be vanquished by application of drain and toilet cleaner (very strong alkalines). As she put it, simple alchemy: if the brute spits ph1 at me, then I\'m jolly well going to respond with lots and lots of lovely ph14. Acid plus alkali equals salt and water, Captain Carrot. Any organic material subjected to caustic potash is reduced to soap. SHE is going to be a puddle of salty soapy water in no seconds nothing!"\n In the Star Wars/Mass Effect crossover Origins, the "hibridium"-based cloaking devices aboard Trans-Galactic Republic and Republic Intelligence Service ships fail to conceal the ship\'s magnetic properties, meaning if one drops a strong enough magnet near the ship its presence will be revealed as said magnet is pulled toward the physically-invisible target. Aria T\'Loak, never one for games, exploits this to blackmail RISE. It starts off okay but ultimately doesn\'t end well...\n Vampires in My Immortal are vulnerable to steak. Early in the fic, the protagonist, herself a vampire, contemplates committing suicide with one she hides in her bedroom.\n Also, vampires are not only vulnerable to crosses, they apparently can\'t even write the word "cross." Of course, the story sometimes forgets all that and depicts vampires wearing cross earrings.\n In Shinobi Of The High Seas Kizaru has been beaten twice by  using a mirror to reflect him away.\n In Hope For The Heartless, water causes the Horned King severe burns. Snow causes that also if it melts on him. Diluted water (such as tea) burns him as easily as pure water, though not as severely. However, he seems to be able to digest wine.\n In the Star Wars fan film Pink Five Strikes Back, Rebel pilot Stacy realizes that since the walkers attacking Hoth only had forward-facing guns, the Rebels could\'ve just shot at them from behind. While being chased by a scout walker in The Return of Pink Five, Stacy remembers this train of thought in the nick of time - and causes the walker to lose its balance and crash by running in between its legs.\n In Group Of Weirdos, the Iron Knuckles are completely invincible, unless tag-teamed and attacked repeatedly by Link, the hero of time, and Ganondorf, a dark wizard with great power. Or you can just slash them a few times with a Deku Stick.\n In Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series video "Marik Plays Slender", Marik theorises that The Slender Man has a weakness against bathrooms, since he doesn\'t show up in the tiled corridor:\nMaybe going to the toilet is like his kryptonite. "I\'m going to kill you! Heh heh heh... what\'s that, you need to go Number 1? Here, I\'ll just wait outside while you deal with that, OK? Make sure you wash your hands, OK, I don\'t want it to be gross when I kill you. Well, I do, but not like that."\n In Ultra Fast Pony, Rarity thinks she\'s allergic to water. Applejack calls her out on the stupidity of this, but Rarity points out that every time she hangs out in the rain for extended periods of time, she gets a cold. Then Rarity develops a nasty rash all over her face. "I told you I was allergic!"\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Animation\xa0\n The Blue Meanies from Yellow Submarine are repelled by positivity in any form. This doesn\'t work out so badly, though, since their entire arsenal is built around the proliferation of depression and despair, but it does still leave them vulnerable to music.\n This trope appears as a pastiche in Bolt. The titular dog believes he has superpowers because he never leaves the set of a TV show. When he is accidentally shipped across the country his powers "mysteriously" vanish, and he blames the Styrofoam packing peanuts he was shipped with.\n Megamind has Metro Man having a weakness to copper (subverted in that it\'s completely made up by him as a part of his plan to retire). This is even lampshaded by Megamind:\nMegamind: Your weakness is copper!? You\'re kidding, right?\n In The Incredibles, the superheroes of the world were driven into hiding by lawsuits. The creators were deliberately going for a mundane downfall. Then again, it was really the government that was tired of paying the lawsuits and covering for the heroes.\n Stitch of Lilo & Stitch is speedy, clever, and able to lift 3000 times his own size... but is too heavy to swim. One reason falling in water is so damaging is that Stitch tends to panic when he\'s underwater. He eventually starts handle deep water better; one episode of Lilo & Stitch: The Series (the theme of which was conquering your fears) had him fall into a swimming pool, but he manages to keep calm, hold his breath, and climb out without issue.\n The King and I has this in the form of every single solitary minion the Big Bad conjures up. His first pair of minions are giant traditional chinese dragons who ruthlessly attack the teacher\'s ship to the point that it\'s near sinking. How are they defeated? Whistling. Everyone aboard whistles to the tune of a happy song and they dissolve into nothingness.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n The Wizard of Oz gives the trope-codifying example: the Wicked Witch of the West melted when Dorothy splashed her with a bucket of water.\n A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger, the nigh-unstoppable humanoid monster that can kill you in your dreams, has a weakness to people not believing in him. This becomes far funnier when you realise that his weakness is the same as Tinkerbell!\n In the Affectionate Parody superhero movie Surge of Power: The Stuff of Heroes, both the hero and villain have their powers nullified by the presence of peppy music. Fortunately the hero is able to save the day with his incredible accuracy with slingshots.\n The aliens in Signs. It\'s hard to feel threatened (retrospectively) by creatures which will dissolve in an April shower or corrode in a particularly humid breeze. And are completely incapable of breaking down wooden doors.\n In Shyamalan\'s earlier film, Unbreakable, water is also used as a weakness for the main superhero character. In that case, though, it isn\'t that he is especially vulnerable to water, but rather he is just as susceptible to drowning as a normal person. If he drinks something too quickly, he will choke and if he is submerged he will succumb to drowning just like everyone else \u2014 though it was theorized that the dense bone and muscle that make him unbreakable also make him unfloatable (or the character simply can\'t swim). There is a complicating factor in the scene where he ends up almost drowning in a swimming pool: he\'s tangled up in a big piece of fabric, which would give anyone a bad time while in water. It is also a psychological weakness: he had almost drowned once as a child (probably due to the aforementioned bone density), an event so traumatic he blocked it from his memory. That would make anyone nervous around water, even if they couldn\'t remember why.\n Shyamalan probably got the weakness idea for Signs from Invasion of the Saucer Men, whose aliens were melted by light. There is nothing lamer. Especially considering they were done in by  the headlights of teenage hot rodders!\n The Bioraptors (also called "Demons") of Pitch Black has a similar weakness to light. Though this actually works, as most of the movie is during a solar eclipse and they broke their flashlights. Oddly enough, the creatures are shown moving about in the light, albeit cautiously, before the eclipse. Compare this to later on, when a lighter is enough to make them run away...\n The same thing appeared in Attack of the Eye Creatures. Although, in this case, it was more because They Just Didn\'t Care (and because it was an almost word-for-word remake of Invasion of the Saucer Men).\n Also happens in The Mole People, in which a lost colony of ancient Sumerians living Beneath the Earth had adapted to their lightless conditions to the point where our heroes can kill them with a flashlight.\n In the movie version of The Day of the Triffids, the title monsters are melted by sea water. Nearly as lame. In the original novel, ironically, flame-throwers are among the most effective anti-Triffid weapons.\n The Tenctonese in Alien Nation (the movie as well as the series) are harmed by salt water. Seawater is like acid to them. They live mostly on the Californian coast; while they do develop a tolerance to it, direct exposure is still harmful to them. There is a slightly funny moment when the police find the partially-dissolved body of a Newcomer washed up on the beach. When asked how they were able to identify him, they simply shrug and show his soaked wallet. All his clothes were, naturally, fine too.\n In the Disney Channel movie Up, Up and Away!, the weakness of the superhero family is aluminum foil. However, it\'s never made clear if it was just their family or all supers who are vulnerable to foil. Both Spider-Man and Superman are mentioned to exist in this \'verse, and they don\'t have any weakness to aluminum foil (although Supes has his own weakness). The bad guys definitely assume that all supers have this weakness, as, when Randy claims to have powers, they give him some foil to test it.\n In SYNGENOR, the title creatures were created to be the perfect soldiers for a war with the Middle East. They don\'t need to eat or sleep, are immune to most weaponry, and reproduce every twenty-four hours. Their only weakness? Water is like acid to them. It\'s somewhat hard to be afraid of a super soldier that can be defeated with a super soaker. Or, if worst came to worst, by peeing on them.\n In the Dead Gentlemen Productions (of The Gamers fame) running Demon Hunters series, Duamerthrax the Indestructible is a walking brick that is, well, all but indestructible. He\'s an "earthwalker", a demon said to have been kicked out of hell for being too mean. Unlike other monsters and demons in the mythos, he\'s not susceptible to ordinary injury. He can eat the round of a large-caliber revolver jammed in his mouth ("Mmm! Nice \'n\' leady!") casually regrows limbs after being dismembered, and generally shrugs off what few injuries he even takes while making terrible puns. So what\'s the convenient balance? We\'re told that every earthwalker has a weakness to some substance, "a plant, metal, anything". Duamerthrax\'s turns out to be mint. Being shot repeatedly at close range with numerous handguns does little more than inconvenience him, but the breath of someone having just used breath spray causes him intense pain, water-guns full of mouthwash can inflict serious harm and mint dental floss can do even worse things. Ultimately subverted; he turns out to have faked his defeat when the body cont got where he needed it, regenerated almost immediately, and the credits show him happily dancing away. Then he gets hit by a car and sent back to hell in the beginning of the second movie.\n Mars Attacks!. The Martians\' weakness is hearing high-pitched yodeling, such as in the song "Indian Love Call" by Slim Whitman, which causes their heads to explode.\n The Tomatoes in Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! have the same weakness, in the form of a song called "Puberty Love".\n The Mummy (1999): Imhotep in his incomplete form is immediately chased away when a cat is in his presence, because they guard the Underworld. Naturally, the heroes never do anything to exploit this weakness, such as by putting cats in the room full of the people he needs to kill to stop being vulnerable to cats.\n From 1966 superhero parody Rat Pfink A Boo Boo: "Remember, Boo Boo, we have only one weakness... bullets."\n Like the Dalek example given below, in RoboCop (1987), the killer robot ED-209 chasing the title character is taken out of play simply by trying to chase RoboCop down stairs that its chicken-walker legs are ill-suited to negotiate.\n In an Homage to The Wizard of Oz, Death in Six String Samurai is killed when squirted with water.\n Derek Zoolander can\'t turn left until his Big Damn Heroes moment. (Though continuity nitpicks will note that he does turn left (relative to himself, though not the camera) while in disguise while trying to retrieve Maury\'s computer.)\n The Spiderwick Chronicles provides a literal weaksauce weakness: Tomato sauce is corrosive to goblins. (This was not in the original book.)\n Mystery Men: Invisible Boy\'s weakness is anybody looking at him while he is invisible. (Machines, like motion detectors and cameras, don\'t trigger this.)\n The Super Cop in Super Fuzz has super speed, super strength, invulnerability, telekinesis and so on, but he completely loses his powers when he sees the color red (probably a nod to Green Lantern and his vulnerability to yellow): a red traffic light, a red flower, a red ribbon, and he\'s harmless.\n The Psychlo homeworld of Battlefield Earth can be blown to (relatively) tiny bits with a nuclear explosion. You\'d think that a nuclear bomb is substantial enough to bypass the Weaksauce bit, but remember that this is a PLANET. It\'d be like a human exploding in a smear of gore after stubbing their toe. The given reason is that the planet\'s atmosphere ignites upon the slightest exposure to radiation. This, of course, implies that the planet completely lacks in any heavy elements.\n Sleepwalkers has monsters that are Made of Iron, except when scratched by house cats.\n As is the usual with horror movie monsters, the 1973 Blaxploitation movie titular character Blackenstein was Immune to Bullets, fists, and blunt objects \u2014 traits which, when added to his Super Strength, seemingly made him all but unstoppable. What is it that finally laid the mighty monster low? The primal forces of nature themselves or divine intervention? No. The police sicced the hounds on him. That\'s it. Doberman Pinscher fangs trump bullets, apparently.\n Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Blaster is the immense Dragon to Master. According to people who want him dead and have been hunting for the right assassin to get the job done, "He can kill most men with his breath." His weakness: he can\'t stand high pitched noises. Max discovers this when the car alarm on his vehicle renders Blaster into a writhing, screaming, mess \u2014 and promptly figures out that his old police whistle can have the same effect.\n The undead mutant warrior things from the 80s flick Neon Maniacs are virtually invulnerable except, like many other things on this list, they can be dissolved with a squirt gun.\n The goblins from Troll 2 are defeated when Joshua eats a double-decker bologna sandwich in front of them during the film\'s climax. They can\'t come within 20 feet of you after you eat 2 bites of bologna.\n Ernest Scared Stupid\'s titular monsters are these trolls, who legend speaks of them being weak to... milk.\n In The Lair of the White Worm, a vampire\'s natural enemy is the mongoose due to vampires in this universe being snake-people. The mongoose ends up getting killed anyway but it\'s still enough to make the Big Bad retreat for a while. Also, playing the bagpipes puts them in a trance.  Unless they have earplugs.\n In Hook, the Lost Boys exploit Captain Hook\'s fear of the sound of ticking clocks, which they attribute to Hook\'s memories of being pursued by a clock-swallowing giant crocodile. Subverted when Peter points out that Hook can\'t really be afraid of the crocodile,  which he killed years ago; rather, Hook is afraid of time, as he\'s become an old man beneath his wig and make-up, and old age is hardly a fear that can be dismissed as Weaksauce.\n Superman IV: The Quest for Peace brings us the horror that is Nuclear Man who, for reasons unknown, is powered solely by the sun. The minute he is out of direct sunlight he stops dead. Even if he\'s in a well lit room but slightly in the shade then he\'s next to worthless. This is especially pathetic when you consider that, in canon, Superman\'s own powers are ultimately derived from sunlight, but *he* doesn\'t power down in the shade - at least not unless he has to use his powers a lot before the next time he can catch some rays.\n In The Traveler, the only way to counter Mr Nobody is actually by letting him hear his real full name, which will make him lose powers and become vulnerable to physical attacks. Kinda makes sense for him to conceal his identity throughout the film.\n Played for laughs in Evolution, where the aliens\' critical weakness is to dandruff shampoo.\n Hancock\'s only weakness? His real wife. Any attempt to live a loving, fulfilling life with his wife of 3,000 years will cause them to both become mortal in order to die together. Unfortunately, Hancock has a hero complex to save people. Which attracts bad guys who attack them in their weakened state. They argue, he leaves, they meet again and the whole cycle starts again. His wife says the gods who created them gave this as a gift. So that they could find love and be happy, and not have to see everyone they care about die as they remain unchanged and alive.\n R.O.T.O.R. is about a robotic policeman gone mad. He\'s almost unstoppable except for being paralyzed by loud noises. This might not sound that dumb, until you witness him repeatedly frozen by people honking their car horns at him or playing a radio a little too loud.\n The Sensory Overload to the Kryptonians in Man of Steel. Good thing Supes learned how to control it and unfortunately, so did Zod.\n Marcus Wright in Terminator Salvation is every bit as tough and unstoppable as you would expect from a terminator... except for his glaring exposed weakpoint in the form of his organic human heart (which isn\'t even covered with any sort of armor; it just hangs there in a big gaping hole in his chest, leaving it completely exposed to any stray pistol shot or well-aimed punch).\n In Godzilla (2014), Godzilla\'s arms are very stubby compared to the rest of him. The male M.U.T.O took advantage of this a couple of times by jumping on his head and stabbing away at him with those long forelegs, with Godzilla having an extremely difficult time dislodging him since he could barely touch the top of his head. They are plenty strong, though, and he uses them to fight the female Muto.\n The titular Nightmare Man is a pretty powerful fertility god, he can kill people, grab and crush people\'s hearts by sticking his hand in, control dead people as puppets, etc....his weakness, if the person he\'s possessed is on anti-psychotic pills he can\'t do anything at all.\n The aliens in the French comedy Le Gendarme et les extra-terrestres are physically tough, can teleport, and can appear as any person they desire. What\'s their weakness? Water (note: the film predates Signs by a few decades). Apparently, they\'re Mechanical Lifeforms (they\'re shown drinking motor oil at one point) and rust at the slightest touch of water in a matter of minutes. The worst part? They came in peace! It was the gendarmes\' aggressiveness that made them hostile. In the end, the aliens are destroyed (with water, naturally), and the gendarmes are hailed as heroes.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Gamebooks\xa0\n The Darklords of the Lone Wolf gamebooks are (were, as of Book 12) crippled by clean air and can only unleash their full strength in toxic habitats. Half the reason they waged a centuries-long campaign ruining Magnamund (the other half being that they are Always Chaotic Evil embodiments of evil) is (was) to make the world a paradise for themselves. Even in their weakened state they can still put up a good fight with their mastery of Black Magic and immunity to conventional weapons. In one story arc, the Darklords develop a magical engine that allow them to retain their full strength outside their realm. About a dozen of them are on the frontlines of their war when the protagonist smashes the engine, singlehandedly ending their reign of terror.\n In one Choose Your Own Adventure book, The Enchanted Kingdom, your character visits a mystical land populated by fairies. You find out that they have the standard folklore aversion to iron, but when some ghouls break your sword, you find out the ghouls are weakened by the presence of plastic when you pull out the only blade you have left, your Swiss army knife.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n The Wicked Witch of the West from the The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was done in by a pail of water. This was explained in the book (but not in the movie) as due to her being "dried up by years of evil" but no indication was ever given that water would kill her. The book does mention that the Witch would never go near Dorothy when she bathed because she hated water.\n The Wicked Witch is not the only one afraid of water: while Tin Man doesn\'t melt, he rusts to the point of total immobility - even though he shouldn\'t.\n Another Oz-related Weaksauce: the Nome King was an extremely powerful, nigh-invincible subterranean fairy who had armies of nomes... all of them, including him, could be weakened to the point of being killed by eggs. This doesn\'t look as bad as it seems at first, because there\'s only one chicken in Oz, and even that one was brought there from Kansas.\n Pv P parodied it here.\n Tik-Tok is an impressive clockwork man, whose processes (thinking, movement, and speech) are powered by three separate springs which need to be periodically wound, or he\'ll run down. And he is unable to wind them himself. Leaving him alone for more than a few hours is all it takes.\n Wicked, a parallel novel based on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, explores the Wicked Witch of the West\'s weakness to its entirety, explaining that since birth, exposing her skin to water hurt her, so she had to clean herself with oil and find creative solutions for things which normally involve using water. When she cries, it\'s like acid flowing down her face. Weakness to water could be the result of the unexplored concept of being "a daughter of the dragon". Its also implied that if Elphaba had ever come into the fullness of her powers, water would cease to be a true threat to her (at one point she instinctively freezes a lake, allowing her to cross it unharmed). The Musical adaptation openly mocks the entire idea of water melting the Witch. Elphaba uses this urban legend about herself to fake her own death at Dorothy\'s hands.\n The weakness from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is spoofed in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, where evil wizards can be melted with water\u2014but only with soap and lemon juice added. The good witch Morwen, on the other hand, explicitly does not melt. It is later theorized that this might be because the wizards never shower while Morwen is something of a neat-freak. Eventually, the heroes refined this into a one word spell with the same effect. One very memorable word, too:  Argelfraster!\n The aliens in The War of the Worlds were killed by a common disease. The aliens were so advanced and germophobic that they wiped out all microbial life on their native planet. Which meant they had nothing to develop immunities to when they invaded Earth.\n The Martians, in Ray Bradbury\'s The Martian Chronicles, are killed en masse rather early in the book by a human-induced plague of chicken pox. It\'s a knowing reference to both American history and The War of the Worlds.\n Harry Potter\n The Boggart in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban seems to be almost an incarnation of this trope. A Boggart will materialize in the form of a person\'s worst fear (though exactly what that means is debatable). The way to repel one is to forcibly imagine the fearsome thing as something ridiculous, and then laugh at it. Alternatively, the Boggart can\'t handle trying to frighten more than one person at once, as attempts to materialize into more than one person\'s fear results in things such as the "half a slug" incident. This is why Lupin advised his students not to face a Boggart alone (combined with the above reason).\n Pottermore goes a little more into detail with the boggart - since they\'re nearly impossible to kill and feed off emotion, they\'re incredibly dangerous to Muggles, but given that Riddikulus is such a simple spell that a thirteen-year-old can learn it in minutes, even a very powerful boggart is a minor nuisance to a prepared wizard. At one point, it describes a boggart that had fed on the fears of local Muggles and become "an elephantine black shadow with glowing white eyes"... only to then note that a Ministry wizard was able to trap it in a matchbox.\n Voldemort\'s inability to understand Love, and The Power of Love, proves to be his ultimate undoing. However, this is more of a Fatal Flaw. Harry does not beat Voldemort because of some mystical aspect of love, but because having reliable friends and allies ultimately gives him an advantage over Voldemort, who underestimates the capacity of others to behave selflessly because he would never even consider doing so himself.\n In the Sin War trilogy, Diablo, the Lord of Terror and one of the three most powerful evil things in existence, is defeated by a reflective surface. Diablo appears as things you fear, and if it\'s bad enough to scare Diablo, it\'s pretty bad.\n Eddings\' The Redemption of Althalus featured both one protagonistic and one antagonistic Five-Man Band, both with similar power arrays. The villains included the evil mind-leech Koman, with telepathy and mind-warping abilities... who was defeated when Althalus thought about random numbers. Fractions of numbers, even.\n Discworld examples:\n The Auditors in The Science of Discworld III: Darwin\'s Watch. There are very logical and clearly worked out reasons why chocolate kills them in Thief of Time, due to some peculiar circumstances. In SoDIII, though, it just does.\n Non-incarnated Auditors can be killed by getting them to say "I", "me", or otherwise admit individuality. Since it\'s widely known that (a) only living things have individuality, (b) all living things die after some amount of time and (c) any living thing\'s lifespan is practically no time at all compared to the universe\'s, any Auditor who admits individuality instantly dies. By the perspective of the rest of them, this isn\'t much of a loss, since there are more Auditors than there is anything else in the universe and, by definition, any given one of them is supposed to lack any defining characteristics.\n Much of the plot of Carpe Jugulum concerns a group of "modern" vampires attempting to subvert this trope by developing resistances to the traditional vampire weaknesses.  They ultimately fail to do so.\n Discworld vampires play this trope in a weird, All Myths Are True way. ALL weaknesses you might have ever heard of apply to SOME vampire, but you may have to do trial and error to find out which ones apply to the particular one who\'s trying to eat you right now. There are also a few with psychological problems that compel them to do things that directly address their particular weakness (such as the vampire flash photographer who works for The Truth, who has a weakness to bright light, and the one who worked at such jobs as pencil maker, garlic stacker, and whole-sale holy water clerk).\n Discworld bogeymen are incredibly strong, reasonably nasty, and some of them can teleport to some extent. Their vulnerability is that they\'re ridiculously susceptible to Clap Your Hands If You Believe. If you can get your head under a blanket, then you believe you\'re safe from the bogeyman and therefore you are. If you can get the bogeyman\'s head under a blanket, he goes into "existiental shock", since he no longer believes he exists.\n In Artemis Fowl, fairy magic can be completely stopped by animal fat. That\'s right, magic that can make you invisible, hypnotize people, heal nearly anything, and in some cases travel through time can be stopped by lard. Praise the Lard!\n Possibly a Logical Weakness instead. Fairy magic is strongly connected to the power of life, so animal fat, as a substance strongly symbolic of death, counters the effects.\n Some of the laws that (most) fairies have to adhere to thanks to some very old, powerful magic\u2014 the most commonly seen are the Ritual for restoring magic (has to be done with an acorn, at the full moon, under an oak next to a bend in the river... or at least to start with. By the second book that\'s already been thrown out as mere myth.), the \'fairies cannot enter human houses without permission\' rule, and by extension, the \'fairies cannot disobey a direct command given by a human eye to eye\' rule.  These are handwaved away by No 1 in the 6th book.\n The Haunter in the Dark, the titular monster in a story by H.P. Lovecraft, is an avatar of the god Nyarlatothep. It\'s a huge winged and tentacled mass of darkness with a three-lobed burning eye, whose touch will burn the flesh from your bones. However, it\'s extremely vulnerable to light. Even little light will hurt it, and strong light will banish it. So you can temporarily defeat an avatar of an ancient and evil god with a flashlight!. Temporarily. As soon as the lights are out, it can come back, just as nasty as before.\n The Michael Vey series features a character with the nickname "Zeus" who can shoot lightning bolts just the god of the same name. He is unable to bathe because the water appears to cause his powers to short circuit.\n In Worldwar, the invading reptilian aliens called \'The Race\' had an immense weakness to ... ginger. Not only was it an incredibly addictive narcotic, but it also made the females produce sexual pheromones outside of the normal fertility cycles, turning exposed members of The Race into crackheaded sex fiends. When the humans attacked Race-occupied Australia, they used missiles armed with warheads packed with powdered ginger.\n Even before they discover ginger\'s effect on the Race females, they find that not only does is it extremely addictive to the lizards, but it also causes them to temporarily feel nigh-invincible - not a good trait for an infantryman, a tank crew commander, or a fighter jet pilot.\n In L.J. Smith\'s Night of the Solstice series the Fair Folk-like race known as the Quislai have many advantages, such as immortality, invulnerability, extreme beauty, the ability to throw lightning bolts, the power to travel to places quickly using secret pathways through space, and freedom from nearly all physical limitations. They can\'t be imprisoned by normal means, as doors and windows will unlock themselves for Quislai, and they can travel through dimensional gateways between worlds without preparation while everyone else requires a special magical amulet to use them. However, the one thing that can restrain them is a thornbranch tangled in the hair. Unfortunately, most Quislai seem too ditzy to think of cutting their hair short or at least avoiding rosebushes.\n The Bible\n Judges 1:19 is often taken by unbelievers and skeptics to argue that iron chariots are a weakness of God; as the King James Version translates it, it reads "And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron." Needless to say, this interpretation is not generally accepted by believers.\n The great Samson got his Super Strength from Nazirite rituals, and breaking them was his big weakness. He attempted to mask this by making up a bunch of equally weaksauce fake weaknesses, only to kill anyone who actually tried them. He was still stupid enough to tell his true weakness to Delilah, despite her being the only one who knew of his "weaknesses" and therefore the only one who could have told them to his enemies. By the time he\'d cut his hair (famously thought to be his sole weakness), he\'d already violated other parts of the Nazirite rituals, such as drinking alcohol and handling dead bodies. Cutting his hair was the last straw, so to speak.\n The Death World creatures of Fragment are averse to salt water and avoid it (it\'s toxic to them for some reason), which is presumably what\'s kept them confined to Henders Isle. This is discovered accidentally by a lucky fool who blunders into a saltwater pool while fleeing the orgy of death chasing him, and is later adapted as a defensive measure against Henders creatures.\n The main weakness of vampires in Peter Watts\'s Blindsight-verse is geometry. If right angles take up too much of their visual field, they have massive, frequently fatal seizures. Right angles are very rare in nature, but once humanity developed architecture the vampires went extinct until later humans reconstructed them and developed "anti-Euclidean" drugs to counter the special vampire weakness (and keep the vampires dependent).\n In the Simon\'s Quest volume of the Worlds of Power series, Dracula\'s vengeful spirit can be driven off by bad jokes.\n In Fred Saberhagen\'s Book of Swords and Books of Lost Swords series, Shieldbreaker, the Sword of Force, can defeat any weapon, and as such is the only thing that can defeat, even destroy, one of the other Swords, but is powerless against an unarmed man. In the final novel, Shieldbreaker is destroyed by Woundhealer, the only one of the Swords which cannot be used as a weapon.\n In The Wheel of Time, channelers are people and therefore are vulnerable to all the things that squishy humans are (though they can do things to help offset that). However, they are particularly vulnerable to Forkroot tea. In normal humans, it\'s harmless, if at most a mild sedative. In channelers it cuts off their ability to use their magic and knocks them out.\n Not to mention that of those who naturally develop the ability to use the local flavor of magic have a 75% chance of it being fatal without instruction.\n Trollocs and Myrddraal (the local flavor of evil Mooks and Lieutenants) have the old folk story weakness of not being able to cross running water. Myrddraal, with sufficient coaxing, could drive Trollocs to cross water, but it needed a damn good reason.\n In Nick Perumov\'s novel Diamond Sword, Wooden Sword, magic-users are vulnerable to the herb swamp crower. Its smoke makes everybody cough, but magic-users also temporarily lose their powers.\n In Bystander Lucretcia won the Superpower Lottery. But, she has two big weaknesses. First, she is weak against hot weather. A warm summer day means she can\'t leave the air-conditioned car, or she\'ll blister instantly. Two, she sucks at using her powers. Especially fighting. Being as strong as Superman isn\'t much use when you can\'t HIT the opponent!\n Goosebumps\n The kids in "How To Kill A Monster" have to figure out exactly how to do that. Falling three stories doesn\'t stop him nor does poisoning a pie. Luckily, there\'s a Deus ex Machina way out.  the monster dies after they confirm they\'re humans, as he\'s allergic.\n In "Attack of the Mutant", there\'s a subversion of the trope that\'s invoked to then play the trope straight. Specifically, the young male protagonist is facing an enemy supervillain who has the ability to change into anyone and anything. The boy knows in advance that if the supervillain were to change into a liquid, he\'d get stuck that way and be defeated, which is the supervillain\'s Weaksauce Weakness. Since the villain is under the impression that the boy is a superhero, the boy pretends that his Weaksauce Weakness is that he\'s vulnerable to acid. So the supervillain changes into a wave of acid, and after the boy hastily jumps out of the way, the supervillain gets stuck in his liquid-acid form, thus ensuring his defeat.\n Iron against the chaos mages in the Saga of Recluce. Even the strongest bolt of chaos fire can be stopped cold by a thin sheet of iron, and the more powerful a chaos mage is the more they\'re hurt by iron, to the point that what for anyone else would be Only a Flesh Wound will be a One-Hit Kill for an experienced chaos mage.\n Bram Stoker\'s Dracula averts most of the popular traditional weaknesses; for example, he can\'t be killed by most conventional means, and can use his shapeshifting powers during dawn, noon, and dusk. However, he does have unique weaknesses; he can only cross running water during high or low tide (this amounts to 12 hours and 25 minutes per day), needs to keep a small amount of Transylvanian soil in his home, and needs to be invited inside before he can enter a building (considering this is Victorian era England and he is a noble, this is a non-matter).\n Mercedes Lackey has fun playing with the iron weakness of fae; in her SERRAted Edge book series, the good elves not only use their skills as race car mechanics to work up a tolerance to iron, but also gladly use the metal to shield themselves from enemy elf attacks. Also, elf magic goes haywire in the presence of iron.   In fact, the good elves have noticed that iron makes their magic go haywire in extremely predictable and repeatable ways, so they have incorporated it into their defenses and can use it to, for example, negate their enemies\' magic while delivering their own with deadly accuracy.\n In the same series, however, she plays the Trope straight in that her elves have a powerful vulnerability to caffeine.\n The Hunter from the Coldfire Trilogy is one of the most powerful beings in the series, but also fatally flawed in his nature. As part of his Deal with the Devil to stave off death, the Hunter surrendered his power over life, creation, and light. He can no longer use healing magic without dying, sunlight burns him horribly, and he is completely unable to manipulate ordinary fire. A villain in the first book took advantage of these weaknesses by luring him into a cave filled with crystal and used a mirror to reflect what little sunlight there was back at him, with the light magnified by the crystal. Then he was rendered helpless by being placed in an ordinary bonfire.\n Animorphs has one book where the group finds out the Yeerks\' Bizarre Alien Biology allows both them and the hosts to treat instant maple oatmeal as an addictive drug on par with heroin. While they plan on dumping a bunch of Quaker Oats\' finest into the pool the Yeerks use to rejuvenate, they don\'t end up using it as a weapon because it plays merry hell on the hosts as well.\n Captain Underpants loses his powers when he\'s subjected to spray starch. Actually, he doesn\'t, but he thinks he does, in an invocation of the Nocebo Effect.\n In the Codex Alera, all of the various crafters\' fury-granted Elemental Powers can be countered by their opposing element (i.e. dripping water on a firecrafter prevents use of fire furies, putting a woodcrafter in a metal cage nullifies wood furies, etc). Windcrafters have greater difficulty using their wind furies closer to earth, and being covered or surrounded by earth renders their furies impotent. However, they also have another weakness: salt, when it comes into contact with their furies, causes them great pain and disrupts them. As a result, anyone expecting to fight a windcrafter carries bags of salt with them to disrupt their Bullet Time, flight, and other powers. Salt-tipped arrows are a specialist weapon against hostile wind furies, and a salt-tipped arrow is  what Bernard uses to critically injure High Lord Kalarus in Cursor\'s Fury by  disrupting his wind furies in mid-flight, causing him to take a nasty plummet into a forest and introducing him to Newton\'s laws in a most painful and crippling manner.\n The Dresden Files\n All illusion has the problem that anyone capable of using the Sight can simply activate it and no matter how skilled the illusionist, they\'ll be able to see what\'s really going on. While most people avoid using the Sight due to the potential for seeing disturbing, unforgettable things with it, the ability for the most marginally skilled caster to counteract any illusion means that the Council doesn\'t consider it an especially useful discipline.\n Of course, the Sight has its own odd weakness included in the form of permanent and perfect recall of whatever you see. Sounds good until you remember that normally scary things get the terror factor turned up to 11 and you have to relive it every time you think about it.\n All Fae are vulnerable to iron. So much so that Queen Mab, one of the most powerful beings in existence, is scared of an iron nail. The Summer and Winter Knights, while human, inherit this weakness as well\u2014 touching iron completely nullifies all of their Fae powers, which is especially dangerous because one of those powers is the ability to ignore disabling injuries.\n The Nazg\xfbl from The Lord of the Rings are vulnerable to sunlight and fire, and will not cross running water if they can at all avoid it. The first two are actually a Logical Weakness- as creatures of darkness and cold; it makes perfect sense that they wouldn\'t like light and heat - but Tolkien never explains (either in the books themselves or Word of God) why they feared water.\n Tolkien was famous for using existing legends to establish the reason why certain myths are the way they are. The fact that they fear running water is a reference to many mythic demons, who could not cross running water. In-universe, one could infer that it\'s because their cloaked robes are the only things keeping their wraith-forms contained in any semblance of physical form. Trying to cross rapidly moving water would run the risk of their cloaks being swept away, meaning they\'d become intangible and useless until they found replacement clothing to allow them to reconstitute themselves, which is exactly what happened to the ones caught in the flood outside Rivendell. (This also gives them a second reason to want to avoid fire)\n An alternate explanation would be that running water carries the power of Ulmo, the Lord of Waters and one of the most potent Valar. Since things symbolically connected to the other powerful Valar (eagles, the distilled starlight in Galadriel\'s phial, etc) have been shown to oppose creatures of evil, there is some logic behind this.\n The Witch King of Angmar, the most powerful of the Nazg\xfbl and Sauron\'s Dragon, cannot be killed by the hands of men. This invulnerability does not include women or hobbits, so the lord of Nazg\xfbl falls to the blades of Eowyn and Merry, a woman and a hobbit respectively.\n In the first book of Anne McCaffrey\'s Tower and the Hive series, The Rowannote\xa0Technically the second, after To Ride Pegasus, but most fans consider The Rowan the first of the series proper, Prime-level Talents could not travel off-planet, due to Travel Sickness - a severe form of vertigo. They later found out that this wasn\'t the case - one of their own imprinted her own physical condition on the rest. So now the older Primes consider it a phobia, rather than a medical condition.\n All types of the fae in The Name of the Wind are susceptible to iron.\n Star Trek Novel Verse\n A secondary canon Star Trek novel (World Without End) describes Vulcans as being extremely vulnerable to cold, sufficient exposure to Earth\'s winters can kill them much faster than the exposure can kill a human. When staying on Earth briefly with his mother\'s family as a boy, Spock has to be completely bundled up whenever he is walking outside in the snow.\n The Saurians are immensely strong, can breathe almost anything, have incredible stamina\x85but being nocturnal and having huge, sensitive eyes, they can be rendered helpless by shining a bright light. Saurians serving in Starfleet wear protective lenses.\n In Vadim Panov\'s Secret City, Nav\' are non-aging Magic Knights who will survive anything short of Chunky Salsa Rule. Unless the offending item is made of or covered with obsidian. This was successfully weaponized by both Lyud\' in sniper bullets and by Chud\' in obsidian sword coatings. The only record of an inter-Nav\' war also tells of Nav\' warriors wielding obsidian blades.\n Leto II, the God-Emperor of Dune who lived a few millennia, was vulnerable to  water due to his sandtrout symbiosis, which was how he set himself up to be killed.\n Grettir of the Old Icelandic The Saga of Grettir the Strong was considered the strongest man on Iceland, but after being cursed by a revenant, he was afraid of the dark for the rest of his life.\n The Masters in The Tripods had a huge weakness to alcohol. Granted, so does anyone or anything else that drinks too much of it, but in their case, just a small drink of alcohol-laced water was enough to knock them cold and paralyze them.\n The Tanu in Julian May\'s Saga Of Pliocene Exile are much stronger than humans and can survive being hacked up by bronze swords. However, just a scratch from an iron blade is fatal. Iron is also the only way to safely remove the torcs they use to enslave and/or grant psychic powers to humans; attempting to remove one without iron tools will kill the wearer due to psychic shock.\n Epics in The Reckoners Trilogy all have one factor that will at least temporarily negate their powers. They range from incredibly difficult to identify, much less exploit, to ones like ultraviolet light and smoke.\n Much of the first book is dedicated to finding the titular Steelheart\'s weakness, using clues from the one time he was wounded. As it turns out, Steelheart can only be hurt by someone who does not fear him. So the protagonist goads him into blowing himself up with the protagonist\'s own C4.\n The second book\'s Big Bad, a powerful water manipulator who is near omniscient in the flooded New York where she makes her home, has the weaksauce weakness of being an old woman with late stage cancer.\n The Parasol Protectorate has the usual weaknesses for vampires, plus a psychic tether to their hive and a strong aversion to citrus that can be overcome with time. Werewolves are vulnerable to sunlight, silver, airsickness, and basil. In this universe, pesto sauce was invented to weaponize the allergies of both species.\n Trolls in A Fantasy Attraction has a weakness for... [drumroll] flowers. Herbal shampoo by extension.\n In "Rawhide Rex", a short story from Clive Barker\'s Books of Blood, the titular creature is nearly immortal and capable of paralyzing his enemies with a gaze. What does him in, is his pathological fear of menstruating women. To him, the idea is unnatural and smacks of castration. So strong is his fear, he was able to be entombed in a pit for 400 years simply by being buried with a few primitive statues depicting a menstruating woman. Having one of these shown to him, makes him seize up in fear allowing the villagers to lynch him to death.\n In the Sabina Kane series vampires spontaneously combust when attacked with apple-related substances (some examples: Sabina\'s apple cider bullets, applewood stakes, and a can of pepper spray loaded with apple cider instead). Justified by vampires\' ancestral connection to the Garden of Eden, through their progenitors Lilith and Cain. Sabina, however, is immune, because she\'s half-mage. Garlic is pointedly harmless; in fact Sabina\'s Internal Monologue states that the vampires made that up as a smokescreen for the apple thing.\n In Zeroes, Crash suffers pain and discomfort when in the presence of complicated electronics, particularly those which use wireless transmission. Needless to say, the proliferation of computers and cellphones has not had a positive impact on her life.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n Supernatural\n Ghosts don\'t like salt. "Truth in Television", or as close as you can get: A book on ghosts states that they actually can\'t stand salt. If you sprinkle some on your doorstep, they can\'t get in your house. It\'s supposed to be pure.\n The Fair Folk are also weak against salt, sugar, or any granular substance. If some is spilled, they have to stop and count each piece. After losing a fight against one, Sam simply says "Why didn\'t I do this earlier?" and opens the capsule of salt he had on him.\n For some reason the Leviathans  are harmed by Borax, a chemical you can find under the kitchen sink. Interestingly, this might be one of the reasons why the Leviathans targeted America first, since Borax is also used as a common food additive in every country except America. So in other words, the rest of the world is literally Too Spicy for Yog Sothoth!\n Doctor Who is renowned for ending its episodes either by Reversing The Polarity or exploiting the latest Monster of the Week\'s Weaksauce Weakness.\n The most famous example is the Cybermen and their allergy to gold, which underwent a Power Creep, Power Seep, slowly going from "gold dust can gum up the works" to "touch gold, die screaming." It eventually led to "Silver Nemesis" and the hilarious scene of Cybermen being stopped by gold coins and a slingshot. At the time a popular joke was that in their next appearance, just saying the word "gold" to one would kill it. This was quietly ignored in later episodes, since those Cybermen came from an Alternate History (though a Continuity Nod was made in a tie-in website which stated that said Alternate History Cybermen did initially have an "allergy" to gold, but it was eliminated by R&D). No one has actually tried using gold on them yet... As of "Nightmare in Silver", it is revealed that the weakness to gold wasn\'t due to hardware but, somehow, software problems!\n The new Cybermen don\'t have it much better. Their weakness is being given back their emotions; they fry when the humans they\'re made from enter What Have I Become? mode. The Doctor really hates doing this because it\'s turning them back into real people who promptly suffer Death by Despair at the horror of their situation. What makes it weaksauce is that it gets easier and easier to do: "emotions removed" seems to mean "everyone\'s emotions suppressed by a single Emotion Suppress-O-Tron." If you point a sonic screwdriver at the right doohickey in a Cyberman-run facility \u2014 and getting into position to do this takes less fuss with each encounter \u2014 an entire invasion force winds up clutching its heads and falling dead. At least with the old ones, you\'d run out of coins to slingshot eventually.\n The Cybermen had a wide variety of one episode weaknesses in the original series including radiation, cold, plastic, bullets (yes, really) and nail varnish remover.\n "Image of the Fendahl" had the Fendahleen (but not the Fendahl Core) defeated by rock salt. The application of the rock salt involves a shotgun to the throat, which is bound to sting a bit.\n Daleks are famed for their inability to climb stairs, though this was never established in the show. However, they could be blinded by obscuring their rather obvious eyestalks, or incapacitated by pushing them over. One \'60s story even sees a Dalek defeated by pushing it so it faces a wall and then piling rocks around its base to stop it moving. In their very earliest appearance they could only operate by absorbing static electricity, preventing them from leaving their city. This was later ignored, even in "Genesis of the Daleks", which was set earlier. Over time, they became far more credible foes. They were actually shown climbing stairs in 1988\'s "Remembrance of the Daleks" (much to the Doctor\'s horror). In the new series, they cannot only hover but swoop around like crazy ("EL-EV-ATE!!"), remove foreign substances from their eyestalk lens (much to Wilfred\'s chagrin), and incinerate humans on touch.  Their main weakness now seems to be ignorance, given that the Doctor convinced them a Jammie Dodger was a TARDIS self-destruct device. This only worked because the Doctor threatened to "use it" if the Daleks present tried to scan it to verify his claim. Considering Daleks probably haven\'t got any clue about Earth biscuits, it\'s likely a case of uninformed cautiousness.\n The Slitheen, due to their bodies consisting mostly of calcium, messily explode if acetic acid comes into contact with their skin, no matter how little. Cue the squirt guns filled with vinegar.\n "The Fires of Pompeii" has the Doctor fighting seven-foot rock beasts with a water pistol... and winning. Well, irritating them into backing off, not killing them.\n The Sensorites from the classic-era first season. Afraid of darkness and loud noises. They panicked if you turned out the lights (we\'re not talking pitch-black darkness, either \u2014 half-lit darkness a person with modest night vision could navigate was enough) and could occasionally be cowed into submission by raising your voice.\n "Blink" has creatures that can, when no-one\'s looking, move faster than Jack Harkness confronted with a twelve-step program. When seen, however, they can\'t move. The episode plays this up for Nightmare Fuel, as you have to blink sometime... On the other hand, their biggest weakness is being tricked to look at each other. Apparently, a video recording of an Angel is an Angel in itself. The problem is, if you keep staring at it, it\'ll eventually download into your brain. That weakness? It\'s just another trap. Everyone knows to keep their eyes on them, but if you stare into the abyss long enough...\n When an episode of Extras featured the filming of a mock Doctor Who episode, this very trend was parodied with a giant slug who was vulnerable to table salt \u2014 which he conveniently kept on his desk, just within reach of the Doctor. It\'s a reference to Colin Baker\'s first serial, "The Twin Dilemma", where the Doctor really does fight a giant slug. In the novelisation, the Doctor briefly wonders where he could find a lot of salt, before dismissing the idea.\n The Doctor has one of his own: aspirin.\n The Doctor\'s sonic screwdriver "doesn\'t do wood" (Hee hee hee!) in that it can\'t help much against wooden latches and other such things. It also doesn\'t do deadlocks, and can be deactivated by some hairdryers.\n Heroes:\n Sylar could be reduced to a writhing, quivering lump with the use of a tuning fork after acquiring Dale\'s super hearing (though Dale was the same way). This no longer affected him after  he lost almost all his powers in the second season.\n Similarly, Elle possesses powerful electrical powers, but because of them can be incapacitated by a bucket of water, which shorts the circuit and fries her with her own powers if she tries to use them.\n Smallville:\n Aquaman\'s guest appearance explained that he needed to be constantly wet or otherwise have a glass of water or he loses his immense strength and begins to wither. Considering he has had plenty of his own superpowered problems, this is especially glaring.\n Kryptonite is so common that Clark would almost be better off powerless. Especially problematic in the earlier years when his "monsters of the week" got their powers FROM kryptonite.\n This (unbelievably large amount of Kryptonite on Earth) even made Ultraman flee his own reality because everyone had it and wouldn\'t hesitate to use it against him.\n The classic Star Trek episode "Day of the Dove" features an Energy Being which feeds on negative emotions, and so causes total chaos on the Enterprise by provoking conflict in order to feed on it. Kirk eventually figures out that the alien can be driven off by peace.\n Star Trek: The Next Generation:\n In an episode, the crew deals with a hostile silicon-based lifeform that draws its energy from light. They subdue it by turning the ship\'s interior lighting off.\n In another episode the Captain finds an ancient Vulcan artifact believed to be some kind of superweapon. By that time he has realized its critical weakness \u2014 it can only kill people who have violent thoughts. Remaining calm renders it ineffective \u2014 even Worf is able to counter it using this method.\n On All That, Superdude... is lactose-intolerant. Even throwing milk on him will send him to the ground, disabled. The bulk of his rogues\' gallery is dairy-related: Butter Boy, Yo-Girl, Cow-Boy, the Dairy Godfather, & his Arch-Nemesis Milkman. His one foe without quick access to lactose, the Evil Superdude, gets a Nice Job Breaking It, Hero moment when confused bystanders use a pitcher of milk to Spot the Imposter.\n In the \'80s series V, aliens are vulnerable to certain inoffensive bacteria that live in the human digestive tract. It backfires later on.\n The alien "Gua" in First Wave turn out to be badly affected by salt. It affects them roughly like heroin affects humans. One episode featured renegade Gua hiding out in a derelict building snorting packets of McDonald\'s salt. This is the same series where the hero fought the alien invasion using the lost diaries of Nostradamus, so... Technically, we never see an actual Gua. They\'re husks \u2014 cloned human/Gua hybrids. it\'s possible that actual Gua are immune to salt but happen to be crappy genetic engineers.\n Sportacus, the superhero of LazyTown, becomes helpless if he eats things with sugar, like candy. However it may be that he\'s actually weak to processed sugar, as he can eat (and in fact gets stronger) from eating fruits, which also contains sugars.\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Turned on its head by the Gentlemen who die instantly upon hearing a human scream. Because of this they steal everyone\'s voice, making themselves essentially invincible and all the creepier \u2014 they\'re cutting your heart out and you can\'t scream!\n "The enemy of all magic" for the Wizards of Waverly Place is... wait for it... plastic! The villain of the week even manages to take over WizTech by filling the place with plastic balls. Considering how ubiquitous the stuff is in the mortal world, it\'s a wonder magic works at all. In later seasons, all spells can work through phones. Explain that.\n Misfits:\n In season one, Kelly can\'t read minds unless the person is thinking something about her. She advances beyond this weakness by episode 5. But in season 3, her new power, rocket science intelligence, is useless because of her "chavvish" personality.\n In season one, Simon\'s invisibility won\'t work if someone is looking directly at him and he notices. Also in said season, he randomly turns invisible whenever he feels ignored.\n In perhaps the most annoying example, Curtis cannot use his time control power at all unless he feels intense regret or fear. This means if someone important dies, he has to either witness it or cause it in order to undo it. It\'s speculated that he gets over this weakness in episode six of season two. This also happens to be his Berserk Button. He\'s annoyed by this weakness just as much as we are.\n His new power he gained  to become a woman, comes with every disadvantage a dirty Hormone-Addled Teenager could come up with.\n Then after trading THAT power, he gets the power to resurrect the dead, which seems good, but results in an eventual zombification.\n Alisha\'s weakness is her power itself: people want to have sex with (or rape) her the second they touch her, and don\'t even remember it afterwards.\n A dangerous mind-controlling villain cannot control minds unless her victims can hear her.\n A shape-shifting villain feels incredible pain anytime she shapeshifts.\n A villain of the week turns out to be allergic to peanuts, which gets cranked up to Mundane Made Awesome levels and treated as a Kryptonite Factor in the confrontation.\n The new version of the Putty Patrol in season two of Mighty Morphin\' Power Rangers were stronger than their predecessors... but the Z logo on their chests is their power source, and hitting it causes them to fly apart. It is also honking big. This rendered the new Putties the weakest grunts ever. In one episode, children (only some of which were de-aged Rangers) dealt with them using a ball.\n Rangers had a sister series, VR Troopers that had their own Mooks with a bad weakness. The Skugs could be defeated by touching each other.\n In Farscape, Sebaceans are slowly incapacitated by higher temperatures; by higher temperatures, we mean "sweaty but bearable" by human standards. This hits recurring villain Scorpius particularly hard, since as a Scarran/Sebacean hybrid, he has both the crippling heat weakness and glands in his body with no function beyond generating massive quantities of heat, forcing him to insert cooling rods into his brain.\n One episode of The Twilight Zone features aliens that can\'t stand the harmonica.\n The alien "Frogs" (who despite the name look more like humanoid Energy Beings) in Raumpatrouille are immune to hard vacuum and the beams of the human protagonists\' energy weapons pass right through them when they\'re encountered for the first time on the space station MZ-4 in the pilot episode. What kills them in short order once their unprotected bodies are exposed to it? Oxygen. What keeps this weakness from being completely ridiculous in at least that episode is that they\'ve already vented the station\'s entire atmosphere into space and wrecked the life support system beyond repair, so the two Orion crewmembers trapped with them have to improvise (and get them all right the first time, too, because the same trick might well not work twice).\n In Lost Girl, as a wolf-Fae, Dyson is very strong with excellent senses. These senses can be thrown off by kitty litter. Bo is appropriately incredulous.\n The Busters of Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters each have a weak point. Ryuuji (Blue Buster) and Yoko (Yellow Buster) have relatively reasonable and easily dealt with weaknesses, but Hiromu (Red Buster) freezes (to the point of hanging in mid-air) if he gets scared. Which wouldn\'t be too bad, since he\'s rather fearless, in general. Unfortunately, he has an extreme phobia of chickens \u2014 even seeing a cartoon chicken, or hearing the word is enough to lock him down for a while. This happens in battle multiple times. His Buddy Roid partner, Cheeda Nick also has a terrible sense of direction.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Myths & Religion\xa0\n Norse Mythology: When Baldr/Balder, the son of Odin, was born, his mother Frigg made all living things vow not to be able to hurt him. The only living thing that didn\'t make this promise was mistletoe, which would be fatal to him. So Loki, the trickster god, goes and gets an arrow tipped with poisonous mistletoe and has the blind god Hoor shoot it at Baldr, killing him. Baldr\'s death would start a chain of events that led to Ragnarok (see further below for the Devil Survivor example).\n Vampires, the badass creatures of the night who always want to suck your blood, tend to have a lot of weaknesses. Popular tradition holds that you\'re fine as long as you stay in the sunlight, have some garlic, stay inside your house and refuse to let them in, or even wield a simple cross. In fact, pretty much the only traditional weakness of vampires that\'s not weaksauce is the whole wooden stake bit, since getting stabbed through the heart with a pointy stick kills most things. The multitude of fiction involving vampires, though, has led to a multitude of differing weaknesses \u2014 including varying degrees of effectiveness. In some settings, vampires are weak to silver, and other religious symbols affect them as much as Christian ones. Then there\'s the older, more obscure, and even more restrictive weaknesses such as inability to cross running water, or obsessive-compulsive disorder causing the need to count piles of seeds, grains of sand, or other small objects, inability to stand constant bell ringing, and even the need to be invited to enter houses. On the inverse, many of the works that tend toward "non-standard" portrayals of vampires also go at length to mock the traditional weaknesses.\n\n\n\n The Fair Folk are terror-inducing beings of legend and myth, often full-on Reality Warpers... and yet, they can be beaten by a stick of iron, a horseshoe, a length of rowan wood, clothes worn inside-out, or a stick of bread. A popular explanation for the weakness comes from Victorian Era archaeologists, who held that this is all just symbolism for the bronze and stone-working cultures being conquered by iron-working ones. Later academics (like Dr. Diane Purkiss) have shown there\'s no archaeological or historical evidence for this.\n This is an especially big problem for the Nuckelavee of Orcadian folklore. Widely considered the most malevolent elf in all of Scotland, the Nuckelavee is an eldritch horror that resembles a man on horseback, if the man was fused to the horse and both had all their skin flayed off. It rides through the countryside destroying crops, killing travelers, causing floods and plagues and generally being a harbinger for all things bad. How do you defeat this monstrosity? Fresh water, and burning seaweed. The Nucklavee fears freshwater, so much so that it cannot cross a stream, and hides in its oceanic lair during the winter storms. Likewise, it finds the smell of burning seaweed intolerably offensive. However, don\'t provoke the Nucklavee, especially with taunting or burning seaweed, as whenever the Nucklavee is offended, it tries to kill all of the horses in the Orkneys with a hideous disease called "Mortasheen".\n The Irish/Celtic Dullahan, a fearsome headless fairy that rides at night (either alone or accompanied by banshees) to splash buckets of blood into people\'s faces \u2014 to announce the recipient of a face-full will soon die. They\'re also a mean shot with a whip, and sometimes drive horse-drawn carriages decorated with human skulls and femurs. There\'s no known way to actually kill a Dullahan, and the only way to ward one off is to exploit its intense fear of... gold. That\'s right; the Dullahan, possibly one of the most pants-wettingly scary portents of imminent death, can easily be warded off by one of the metals most commonly used to make jewelry.\n\n\n\n Werewolves have their share of weaknesses, too; earlier legends provide ones such as having an iron bar thrown over their head \u2014 although hitting somebody with an iron bar is pretty incapacitating for most creatures \u2014 drawing three drops of blood, or having their name announced one to three times. The popular weakness to silver weapons is a relatively new invention. It often comes with an immunity to anything not made of silver. Most werewolves that don\'t have the silver weakness can be killed by any type of weapon, including silver.\n\n\n\n Basilisks. Okay, they can kill you if you look directly at them, or hear their voice, or if you touch them, or it breaths on you, but guess what? They can be killed instantly by the crowing of a rooster, and their powers don\'t work on weasels. In some legends, Basilisks are also weak to themselves. There are stories of men killing a basilisk by wearing mirrors sewn into clothing.\n Trolls. Yeah, they can rip you limb from limb with their bare hands, but a little sunlight turns \'em into inanimate rocks. One good way to trick a troll into watching the sunrise is to challenge them to a game of riddles: no troll can resist such a challenge. But beware: according to the legends trolls are extremely good at riddles, and if you decide to give up before dawn then they celebrate their victory by eating the loser.\n Many of the oldest portrayals of Satan, the ostensible antagonist to God, has him easily outwitted by peasants and driven away by holy symbols (such as a scapular).\n\n Achilles was the greatest of the Greek Heroes. When he was born, his mother dipped his body in the river Styx (or into a fire, depending on which version of the story it is) so that he would be invincible. The only part of him that wasn\'t affected was his heel, which was where she held him. Given that the trope Achilles\' Heel is named after him, you can guess what happened to him eventually. However, some of the myths indicate that he was shot with arrows poisoned with hydra venom, the same ones that killed Hercules, which deflects the weaksauce bit.\n In folk tradition, salt is often used to repel evil. It was said a circle of salt could protect one from witches, that salt over your doorstep would ward off ghosts and evil spirit. Salt was often seen as a symbol of purity, especially in its uses: Salt is a conservation agent after all, and salt-cured meats don\'t spoil. Salt as a purifier appears in Shinto (Where it is used as a ritual purifier and small mounds of salt can be used to repel evil spirits) and Christianity (where it is used before mass and to consecrate a church).\n In Arabic legend, a ghoul could be killed with a single kick. However, there\'s a flip side: kick the ghoul again and it immediately springs back to life.\n Kappa in Japanese myth are river goblins ranging from mischievous to outright malicious who are said to kidnap children to drown them or tear out their souls and livers. They have a dent in their skulls in which they store water, allowing them to walk on land. Despite their violence, kappa are extremely well-mannered and cannot resist answering a polite bow with an even deeper one. This will cause the water to spill from their heads, forcing them to retreat. Additionally, they love cucumbers even more than children and can easily be distracted with them.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pinballs\xa0\n In Monster Bash, you can collect items (bombs) that can be used during each monster, such as garlic for Dracula or a Silver Bullet for the Wolf Man. The Bride of Frankenstein\'s weakness is a hair dryer.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Tabletop Games\xa0\n In Heavy Gear the advanced Black Mamba Gear \u2014 one of the more powerful designs in either of the two superpowers\' armies \u2014 had exceptionally weak rear armour. The result is that Black Mambas could be (and routinely were in gameplay) easily defeated by lightweight Cheetah scout Gears. While the fluff text initially ignored this, the game\'s designers eventually acknowledged and lampshaded this weakness by having Mamba pilots clamoring for a solution to the "glassback" problem.\n Hero System; Most of the monsters in Lucha Libre Hero take extra damage from lucha combat maneuvers. And since the PCs are by default technico luchadors, there\'s a lot of these showing up in the fight scenes. But then, the sourcebook was inspired by Mexican lucha films, and "every problem can be solved with a good wrestling hold" was standard in those films.\n In GURPS, the disadvantage Supersensitive makes having any other sort of sentient creature with 20 meters a serious weakness. With Combat Paralysis your greatest weakness is being put in any sort of danger. Naturally such disadvantages are not recommended for Player Characters.\n d20 Modern has a table of random weaknesses... including some really stupid ones, such as: Clowns, the number 8, math, and books written by William Blake.\n In the The Dresden Files RPG, all creatures who take some sort of supernatural toughness, regeneration, or physical immunity must take something called "The Catch", which, when used against them, will take out their ability to shrug off damage. The more common/easily accessible the ability to fulfill "The Catch" (so, something everyone knows about and can get easily), the more points you can get back. So, Catches like "Swords Of The Cross", "Wizards Born Under Special Circumstances", "Soulfire", and "Nuclear Detonations" don\'t really offset the power, while more common and known substances (like iron vs Fey, holy items vs Black Court Vampires, or physically attacking magically immune creatures with a brick loaded sock) will give you more points to potentially work with.\n In Deadlands, there are some creatures and villains who are immune to anything except one weakness. For example, a Hangin\' Judge is vulnerable to a weapon held by a legitimate lawman on duty, a Tummy Twister to hot chili peppers, and Jasper Stone to suicide. That last one is technically correct, but it\'s so much more. The conditions are actually "Stone can only be killed by a gun fired by his own stone-cold hands", so suicide counts... but so would redirecting his shot before it hit its target. So would having Young Stone and Old Stone shoot each other.\n Changeling: The Lost has the concept of "frailties", little weaknesses that certain fae (and overly-powerful changelings) are prey to. Some of them are the classic faerie weaknesses, others can be as odd as "must drink alcohol instead of water" or "cannot cross lines of ants". The only universal weakness is iron, which isn\'t as dangerous as you think because pure iron is rare... and steel does nothing. These weaknesses differ from subject to subject; the fiction for one book has a Genre Savvy mortal invoking every bane she knows from the old tales in an attempt to scare off one of the Gentry. None of them work.\n In Rifts, vampires have all the "classic" weaknesses found in folklore; crosses, garlic, wooden stakes, sunlight, as well as a couple usually attributed to other monsters (wolfsbane, silver). One weakness that\'s rather unique to Rifts, and the most weaksauce of all, is running water, in any form. Which means a vampire that can shrug off nuclear detonations and hails of rail gun bullets can be taken down by a squirt gun.\n It\'s possible to give a character in Champions such a weakness via the Susceptibility Disadvantage. Water, for example, could be worth quite a few points depending on how many dice the character takes from it since it\'s one of the most common substances in practically any game world. This would make it impossible for your character to do such simple things as bathe or shower, and any kid armed with a Super-Soaker and/or a bucket of water balloons would become a credible threat.\n Magic: The Gathering: Marit Lage. An ancient, powerful entity. A sorceress transformed into a horror larger and more powerful than even the mightiest of Eldrazi. Capable of killing a planeswalker in one hit. Immune to most forms of direct damage. And, being a token, is vaporised instantly on contact with Unsummon, a one mana spell that was in more than a dozen core sets.\n Anything in Bleak World with the water weakness is going to be this, as such vampires can go out in neither sunlight or rain. Don\'t even get us started on the GM who decides to put the Macguffin at the bottom of a lake.\n In Munchkin, a Limburger Sandwich is a +3 item that also gives an instant victory against the Floating Nose.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theater\xa0\n In Gian-Carlo Menotti\'s opera Help, Help, the Globolinks, the invading Globolinks are repelled by music.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has trolls, which are weak to fire. Guess what the first Destruction spell the player knows is?\n Razputin in Psychonauts cannot go into deep water because of a family curse. Any time he goes near deep water, a hand made of water tries to drag Raz in and drown him. It\'s heavily implied that this is actually a psychosomatic weakness caused by Raz\'s psychic abilities rather than the curse being real however.\n The Mega Man series has plenty of bosses who had a weakness to unlikely-looking weapons and questionable moves.\n The final boss of Mega Man 2 can only be damaged with the most useless and most difficult-to-hit-with weapon, Bubble Lead.  The boss is a hologram; other ammo refills its energy (somehow), while the bubble lead shorts it out.\n Metal Man just takes this Up to Eleven. Most bosses laugh at you when you use their own weapons against them. Metal Man explodes in a single hit like an overripe can of sardines being hit by a chainsaw.\n The final form of Wily in Mega Man 3 can be one-shotted with a proper application of Top Spin, a glitchy and hard to aim attack that often damaged you and would drain the entire bar if mistimed. (Thankfully, Search Snakes also work on it\u2014which has much the same movement pattern as the aforementioned Bubble Lead and would be this game\'s hardest-to-hit-with weapon if not for the Top Spin.)\n In Mega Man X and X2, the final boss forms of Sigma were weak against the Rolling Shield (a hard to aim attack that generally did less damage than a charged shot) and the Strike Chain (a pathetically short ranged attack).\n In Mega Man X2, Violen\'s actually weak against the Bubble Splash, and the weakest variation of Silk Shot that you can only use on Wire Sponge\'s stage; a small clump of leaves. Firing leaves on other enemies isn\'t worth the effort and by the time you used up all of the weapon energy for the Silk Shot, you\'ll only have killed a total of five enemies with it. So it\'s best to use it up against him if you happen to encounter him in the said stage and you have this weapon acquired.\n Wave Man of Mega Man 5 was essentially vulnerable to being kicked.\n This comes up in the series so often that the Genre Savvy veteran of the series will, upon reaching the final boss, immediately switch to the hardest-to-use weapon to try fighting Wily. The cases where this isn\'t strictly true are  Mega Man 1 (Wily is vulnerable to two different Game Breaker strategies), Mega Man 4 (vulnerable to an easy-to-use weapon that is slightly prone to abuse), Mega Man 5, and Mega Man 6 (in addition to fulfilling this trope in those two games, Wily was also vulnerable to Game Breaker Beat, which is why Beat was subsequently nerfed).\n Now we have Street Fighter X Mega Man, where one of the weapons is a watermelon. Since this is a Mega Man game, there\'s going to be somebody from Street Fighter who\'s weak to it.  It\'s Rose.\n Rom Hack Rockman No Constancy makes Za Warudo / The World (which isn\'t even offensive) a One-Hit Kill (at least on Normal mode) towards Clash/Crash Man.\n And this feature is carried to many expies. The list includes, but not limited to, Mega Mari and Rosenkreuz Stilette.\n In the sequel of the latter game, one of the late game bosses can be one-shot with a specific weapon. Guess who if you know the Shout-Out.\n Mega Man himself is notorious for being quite durable for an old-school platformer character... unless you\'re talking about spikes, which kill him if he so much as brushes against one.\n Vampyres in RuneScape avert this somewhat. When they were first introduced, Juvinate or higher ranked vampyres could only be harmed by weapons made of silver.... all of which are weak because silver is a soft metal. So it was more like they were just immortal against everything else, and silver worked as well against them as it did against normal monsters. And then the player learns about the Blisterwood Tree.....\n Don\'t even get us into how this applies to multiple-typed Pok\xe9mon.\n Poor Shedinja. Its ability, Wonder Guard, is great (invulnerable to all direct damage moves except for the types it\'s weak against), but it only has one hitpoint, and its type (Bug/Ghost) gives it five weaknesses\u2014including types and common moves that only an idiot would build a team without. That means it\'s only good against AI opponents that you know don\'t have those type moves (or any of the environment moves that would defeat it as well). Moreover, while it\'s invulnerable to direct damage moves, status ailments could affect it normally. Shedinja could simply be confused, and it would effectively commit suicide. Good luck leveling the poor guy without Exp Share.\n Inversely, Shedinja is an extremely viable option in the Legendary/Uber arena, in that most of the commonly used Legendary Pokemon have no moves that can penetrate Wonder Guard. For example, the near-almighty Kyogre will be generated most of the time with no powers that can hit Shedinja, letting the tiny bug cut him to death. If you can take out the one or two (at most) Pokemon that could beat Shedinja, you\'ve practically assured yourself a victory.\n There\'s also Paras and Parasect, who in the first generation had three Super Effective weaknesses (Parasect is also incredibly slow). One of their new abilities in the fourth generation gives Parasect what is essentially a five fold weakness to Fire. Parasect also gets a 100% accuracy sleep move, which is potentially the most powerful status-inducing move in the game, so this was likely added to keep it from being a Game Breaker.\n The Electric type is half-composed of cute little rodents (and a grinning sphere, too, but those are actually dangerous). You\'ll wind up with one-foot-tall squirrels and mice taking down Gyarados\u2014a 21 foot long sea monster known for destroying entire towns in fits of rage\u2014in one hit.\n Several moves and other things introduced in the fourth generation of the games can cause examples of this trope. One of the most hilarious: a Grass-type move called Grass Knot that is said to work by tripping the opponent, and does more damage the heavier the opponent is. The result of this is that the heaviest Pokemon in existence, the Ground-type Groudon, can often be tripped to death in one hit by something as small as a Pichu.\n Dragons are weak to Ice-type moves. This means that pseudo-legendaries like Salamence and Garchomp can be taken out in one hit by an Ice Beam from a Cloyster. As of Pok\xe9mon X and Y, they\'re also weak to Fairy-type attacks. Averted with Kyurem, though, as Ice is its secondary type. As Fire-types resist Ice, too, this also applies to Reshiram. Double Subversion with the aftermentioned Fairy-type, but only for Kyurem.\n Double subverted with Kingdra. Due to its Water/Dragon type, the only super-effective type, for a really long time was Dragon-type attacks. note\xa0Dragon resists Electric/Grass but is weak to Ice. Water is the other way around. Come Pok\xe9mon X and Y, however, and there is the aforementioned Fairy Type. Moreover, there is a certain Ice Type move which subverts the usual type relations, being super-effective against Water (along with Dragon), and therefore opening up a chance for a 4x weakness attack.\n Volcarona is widely considered one of the most badass Bug-type Pokemon. It and its pre-evolved form (Larvesta) naturally lose half their health from Stealth Rock. Just from switching in. Same with other Pokemon with double weaknesses to Rock, notoriously Charizard.\n All Pokemon that are weak to Water probably count, especially the double-weak ones. Using these critters in battles on the ocean is a common source of head scratching.\n Rock/Ground is a common combination. It\'s double-weak to both Water and Grass, and mons of this type usually have very low Special Defense, so pretty much any attack of these types will be an insta-kill. Ironic, since Rock types are supposed to be difficult to kill. Gen V changed the Sturdy ability to prevent insta-kills, so that they can at least survive with 1 HP and get a chance to attack.\n Fairy-types were introduced in Gen VI, and such attacks are super-effective against Fighting, Dark and Dragon types. Hydreigon, Scrafty, and Pangoro thus have a 4x weakness against attacks that typically involve sparkles and cuteness.\n While fairies are resistant to most commonly-used types like the ones mentioned above, their counters are Poison(a generally-weak type since Gen 1) and Steel(Lost resistance against Dark and Ghost to adapt being Fairy counters instead of defenders).\n Lance, the champion in Pok\xe9mon Gold and Silver, is a dragon trainer. That is, he trains dragon-esque Pok\xe9mon, not Dragon-type Pok\xe9mon. This means all of his Pok\xe9mon are part flying, meaning all of them lose at least a quarter of their health to Stealth Rock.\n Somewhat in keeping with the game\'s theme, the Big Bad of Spore,  the Grox, is weak against... Life! They can only survive on barren planets; creating a life-sustaining world kills them (although their spaceships can still bomb you from orbit).\n Disgaea:\n Laharl, being a young demon who makes a big deal out of being evil, is violently allergic to women with sexy bodies and expressions of optimism or hope. In one battle he has to fight a bunch of half-naked succubi and nekomata with his stats halved. During one of those chapters, Flonne nearly kills him by yelling "eternal love!" (her favourite words). This appears to be largely psychological, however. Laharl learns to accept that he is capable of love by the end of the game, and while he makes a few comments about not wanting Jennifer\'s body near him, her presence has no effect on his stats. In Disgaea Infinite you can even use Mind Control to make him love sexy bodies, and glomp Jennifer. The novels explained this as the result of being raised by an abusive, buxom aunt. Disgaea D2, however, implies it was because the curvaceous Ranier was his nursemaid growing up, and to get him to sleep she\'d smother him into unconsciousness with her considerable... assets.\n The fact that the Prinnies explode when thrown is an unfortunate weakness, as well. It doesn\'t matter how high the level and/or stats of a Prinny is, a simple toss is all it takes to do it in. Unless it\'s one of those Prinnies... In the Prinny games, said weakness can be exploited by a Prinny against some particular enemy Prinnies.\n In Elite Beat Agents, an alien species known as the "Rhombulans" come to Earth and ban music because they\'re scared of it. Then the agents come and get everybody in the world to dance to Hoobastank and the Rolling Stones.\n Sonic is extremely weak in water. Not only can he not swim, he also moves at an extremely slow pace when underwater, and sinks like a stone. In Sonic X, he nearly drowns in the first episode, and he can\'t even move while on ice. Episodes of Sonic Underground and Sonic X were devoted to Sonic\'s aquaphobia. Also, in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Sonic wears a life vest whenever he participates in a swimming event. He eventually overcame this in Sonic the Comic by taking swimming lessons, and Sonic Colors gave Sonic an infinite jump underwater, and his Drill Wisp power works just as well underwater as it does underground.\n Final Fantasy:\n In general, Revive Kills Zombie, so even undead bosses can be easily killed as long as you have a Phoenix Down in your inventory.\n In Final Fantasy V, the Bonus Boss Omega, like hard bosses in general, are designed to have immunity to every status attack the player can throw at him... except for Romeo\'s Ballad. For some reason, this machine of death will specifically never be able to dodge a song about love, and will unerringly be frozen for a (very short) time because of it.\n In Final Fantasy VI the irritatingly durable Platinum Dragons (formerly Wirey Dragons in the SNES version) have no elemental weaknesses and high offense and defense. However, Relm\'s generally useless Sketch ability triggers a monster spell called Cyclonic when she sketches a Platinum Dragon, and it knocks out 90% of their hitpoints. The Ultima/Atma Weapon on the floating island is extremely powerful and has a lot of HP, but dies when it runs out of MP, which it doesn\'t have nearly as much of. The spell Osmose absorbs a neat chunk of an enemy\'s MP and adds it to yours, while the spell Rasp destroys a large amount. Rasp, rasp, rasp, dead.\n In Final Fantasy X, using Provoke on Defender X will force him to use an attack that halves the target\'s current HP for the remainder of the fight (unless the Provoker switches out of battle). Therefore, the fight becomes a Foregone Victory. Many other bosses have some exploitable weakness (some more obscure than others), making a "level one" run easier than you might expect.\n The final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics,  St. Ajora, is incredibly weak to  the Oracle spells of Drain and Osmose, the two easiest spells to acquire for the class. The AI even actively hones in on characters using it  by outright killing them if able, or depleting all their magic if not. However, even a single Chemist is enough to counter these effects, and you can merely have the rest of the party wail on the final boss without it even bothering them for an easy victory.\n In Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, due to a rather unusual bug, the basic Cure spell causes a bizarre rollover effect when used on the final boss of the game, either hitting him for tens of thousands of points of damage, or healing him for that amount. Either way, he typically dies in the following round, likely due to a failsafe caused by his hit points being pushed into negative/out of range values.\n Vercingetorix in Final Fantasy XIII is brutally hard...unless you know he\'s vulnerable to poison. In that case, killing him is simply a matter of inflicting poison, then turtling in a three Sentinel paradigm until he removes the debuff, then repeating. It doesn\'t even take that long.\n Poison also remains extremely powerful in both sequels. This is thanks to its mechanics draining a flat 1% of the boss\' max HP, instead of their current HP, meaning that its effectiveness never falls off, many of the games\' harder Bonus Bosses could be cheesed by laying on poison, turtling with sentinels and a medic, and just waiting it out.\n All of the final bosses of the MOTHER series are established as ridiculously powerful, perhaps even immortal, up until the final fight. Hitting it with any attack will do nothing, so you have to resort to attacking them emotionally. Giegue/Giygas from Mother is forced to retreat because Ninten sings the song his mother once sang to him, destroying his resolve. When Giygas makes his return in EarthBound, Ness and his friends have to send a call out to all of the friends and companions they made during their adventure, including you, who all begin praying that they will be safe, allowing them to win. And finally, at the end of the fight against Claus/Masked Man from Mother 3, Claus deliberately kills himself due to brotherly love.\n In EarthBound, using the Jar of Fly Honey on Master Belch will make him stop fighting and focus on just eating it where you\'ll be given the whole time to drop his HP to 0. He\'s actually unbeatable if you don\'t do this to him, though, as his HP simply won\'t go down until then.\n The Pork Trooper in MOTHER 3 is a rabid DCMC fan, and will waste multiple turns staring at you jealously if you show him a piece of their merchandise. The amount of attack power he possesses is high enough to make him a threat even with his attacks coming only every third turn, however.\n The Ultimate Chimera, despite its name, is the only one that has an on/off switch on its back. However, it turns out that the silly-looking bird on its head isn\'t just a decoration and acts as a fail-safe of sorts, reactivating the chimera once the coast is clear...\n Baldur\'s Gate II:\n The extremely powerful liches rely entirely on magic in combat. There is a relatively low-level spell that allows you to polymorph into a 100% magic-immune and thus undamageable-by-liches creature: The Terrifying Mustard Jelly. Game Breaker ensues. This is arguably also a case of Good Bad Bug, since mustard jellies aren\'t 100% immune to all magic under the AD&D rules that Baldur\'s Gate is based upon; they merely resist certain elements and status effects but are affected normally by other spells.\n Also, all healing spells have reverse effects on undeads. The mid-level spell that heals someone back to max HP? It reduces any undead to one HP. Including an epic dracolich.\n Taken even further with Bonus Boss Kangaxx. While he is definitely one of, if not the strongest enemy in the game, his death resistance is piss poor. There are so many ways of taking advantage of these, along with Good Bad Bugs, that someone wrote the song parody "Fifty Ways to Kill Your Kangaxx." ("Use Protect Against Undead, Fred.")\n inFAMOUS:\n Cole has the standard "electric super" Weaksauce Weakness of water... but also has one in chain-link fences. The metallic mesh absorbs his shots and dissipates them harmlessly. He has to go around to shoot whatever is on the other side \u2014 since every last chain link fence in the game is capped with razor wire and can\'t be climbed. Penny Arcade didn\'t let this go without comment. It\'s even lampshaded in the sequel \u2014 you can now climb over chain link fences, and there\'s a trophy for doing so for the first time, celebrating this amazing achievement.\n He has another weakness: areas without flowing electricity. If there isn\'t an active power grid where he is, he suffers from severely blurred vision and is said in dialog to be generally impaired, though this doesn\'t really show in gameplay.\n In [PROTOTYPE], Alex Mercer and the Infected have a Weaksauce Weakness in water. Their biomass is too dense to float. Alex and Hunters will just jump back out of any body of water they fall into after a brief pause. The Infected not so much. However, it takes place on Manhattan Island, so besides the surrounding water that makes it an island, there\'s not a lot of water to use. Makes the quarantine easier to keep, though.\n \u014ckami monsters:\n The "Bloom" technique, that causes flowers to sprout from trees, will also open bud-based enemies and reveal their weak point.\n Umbrella-wielding and flying enemies are weak to "Galestorm" which most of the time isn\'t any more powerful than a moderate breeze.\n The Tengu can be calmed down from going berzerk by causing it to rain.\n The Big Bad is weak to  sunlight, but then again,  he is a god of Darkness.\n The Bonus Bosses of Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis are very powerful, to say the least. However, they all share a common monster trait that renders them vulnerable to a certain character\'s normal physical attack. Said character is one of the highest physical attackers of the game (plus, he also has a skill that increases his attack power even more), and abusing the weakness will quickly increase the Limit Break meter, allowing faster access to the uber-powerful Finishing Bursts. This is a saving grace, however, since one Boss Battle has you fighting three Bonus Bosses at once.\n In Devil Survivor, the Nigh-Indestructible enemy Beldr is only harmed by Devil\'s Fuge  AKA Mistletoe, which the only thing made of said plant you can get your hands on is a cellphone strap that is only made in the image of mistletoe. Makes up for it by being That One Boss of the game, but still a rather undignified weakness\u2014but justified, due to the boss\'s background origin.\n An odd case in Tales of Phantasia, which isn\'t a conventional weakness, but more of a developer\x92s oversight. The Bonus Boss of the Bonus Dungeon, Pluto, only has physical attacks, and one ridiculously long charging special attack, all of which have insane amounts of damage behind them, but must be used at close range. The first skill the main character ever learns is a long range, one SP cost move called Demon Fang\', which instantly pushes Pluto back and flinches him. Hence, a Bonus Boss battle where the heroes stay on oneside and nuke the poor guy and the lead constantly pelts him with Demon Fangs, while the boss sits on the other side of the screen defenseless.\n Castlevania:\n  Castlevania II: Simon\'s Quest features the easiest fight against Dracula in the entire series. There are two weapons  the golden knife and the sacred flame which cause Dracula to completely freeze in place. All Simon has to do is repeatedly spam those weapons, and he\'ll win before Dracula can even move.\n In Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, there\'s an optional battle with the spirit of Richter Belmont, one of the most powerful vampire hunters ever to walk the Earth. The easiest way to beat him is to keep throwing pies in his face, as the downward arc of the Cream Pie sub-weapon lets you safely jump and toss them while staying out of range of his whip and axe. Also the pies are Darkness elemental and boss is weak to Darkness, but that actually doesn\'t make much difference since the pies still aren\'t very damaging.\n Resident Evil:\n It seems that human(ish) enemies in the series are more vulnerable to melee attacks than they are to heavy firepower and ordnance. Krauser from part 4 is weak against Leon\'s knife, and in part 5, the first two fights with Wesker can be considerably shortened by clobbering him with as many QTE combos as possible.\n In Resident Evil 4, the Plagas that hatch out of the various Ganados are either Demonic Spiders or Goddamned Bats, depending on your opinion. However, once "popped", they can be killed instantly with a single flash grenade... yes, that\'s right, the otherwise useless blue grenade you\'ve probably been selling off for upgrades and beefier guns.\n The final part of your fight with Krauser is a pretty tough boss fight...until you realize that your knife does about as much damage as a Magnum bullet and similarly causes him to stagger.\n In Diablo II, a Paladin using the skill Blessed Hammer (commonly known as Hammerdins) are capable of throwing dozens of high-damage hammers at a time, even into the highest difficulties. Their weakness? Walls. Since the hammers arc in a circular pattern, it can be extremely difficult to defeat certain monsters who are positioned in a difficult spot. There\'s a reason why the most effective equipment for a Hammerdin has an item that provides the Teleport spell: because there\'s quite a few mandatory sections of the game that are best served teleporting around, avoiding enemies, grabbing the one item you need, and getting out of there.\n Ormagodden from Br\xfctal Legend was killed by being doused with mud.\n Penny Arcade Adventures features a literal example: the special-attack weapon "Double-Mild Weaksauce" is such a wimpy hotsauce that it actually makes enemies wimpier and more vulnerable when you shoot it at them.\n Although not a flaw of the units themselves, ground units in X-COM Apocalypse can only travel on roads and if the road square they are on is destroyed so are they. Especially galling with the Assault Tank which is pictured as having huge caterpillar treads but still can\'t go off-road.\n In The Secret of Monkey Island, Big Bad Le Chuck is destroyed by  root beer.\n In Nelly Cootalot, there\'s El Mono, who guards the gates to the mine/spoonbeaks\' prison, with some pretty powerful (as Adventure Game standards go) magic. So what is an ordinary Pirate Girl to do? After doing a few more errands, the answer will come in the form...of an orange.\n Kirby: Meta-Knight isn\'t afraid to get bloody in battle...but he is afraid of losing his mask. Every battle with him ends with his mask coming off, revealing that he\'s every bit as cute as the rest of the inhabitants of Pop Star. He immediately wraps himself in his cape and leaves.\n Halo:\n Scarabs are somewhat easily beaten in Halo Wars, stick an infantry unit too close for it to hit and send your army after it while it\'s stuck. They tend to die quick unless they have engineers.\n In the first game, the Hunters were enemies who could easily ruin your day. The best way to kill them, other than a rocket, was a single Pistol round to the unarmored area in their back. That\'s right, just one Pistol bullet. Justified in-universe in that said pistol fired high-explosive armor piercing rounds, but still. Bungie nerfed this ability of the pistol in the games later in the series.\n Kanbari in Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is weak to physical attacks, and each hit against him generally results in a cooperative attack with your allies. To be fair, he\'s the god of the toilet, so players are right not to expect much. Be careful, however - Kanbari does know Tetrakarn (which reflects physical attacks).\n The most likely candidate for the Big Bad of BlazBlue, Terumi, is, story-wise, one of the most powerful beings alive...and he is allergic to cats. Horribly allergic. So allergic that  his joke ending has him reduced to a sniffling sneezing chew toy of the Kaka kittens. It\'s hinted to be canon too; in one scene he mentions that he hates the smell of cat. It\'s possible that Relius Clover, a Jerkass in his own right, added those allergies when he created Terumi\'s current body as a twisted joke.\n Kratos from Tales of Symphonia\'s weakness is tomatoes. His son Lloyd seems to have inherited that weakness. Every playable character in the game has a least favorite food in the same way \u2014 Kratos\' is just the only one that became memetic, probably because he\'s so stoic as to become The Comically Serious. It\'s not like they can ever get used against him in battle or anything.\n Captain Novolin is weak against junk food. It makes him sick when he gets near it.\n Hooktail, the boss of Chapter 1 in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, has a weakness to things that start with "cr" and end with "icket".  This is because she ate some crickets a long time ago prior to the game\'s events, and the sound of crickets became so unbearable to her that she never wanted to eat a single cricket again. Equipping a certain badge that makes a cricket sound lowers her attack power and her defense drastically, making her easier to defeat.\nHooktail: Bleck! That awful sound! It... sounds like a cricket! How did you know?\n In SimCity 4, most buildings and infrastructure will crumble to pieces if you move the ground near them.\n Touhou: In Immaterial and Missing Power, Patchouli tells Youmu that she ought to be weak to fire since she\'s (half) an undead. Youmu replies that it doesn\'t apply to ghosts. In the end her human half turns out to be weak fire, but then again who isn\'t?.\n In her scenario, Patchouli ends every fight by listing her opponents\' weaknesses that often turn out to be weaksauce (although the validity or application are doubtful):\n Reimu: Wasabi.\n Marisa: Eel.\n Sakuya: Asian ginseng, bitter melons.\n Alice: Chili peppers.\n Youmu: Bitter melons.\n Remilia: Lots of weaknesses....\n Yuyuko: Fire.\n Yukari: Dried plums.\n Suika: Fried beans.\n Youkai are said to be able to regenerate physical damage very fast, but are weak to faith.\n In Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, there\'s Rumia, the Stage 1 boss. She has the power to control darkness itself...but whenever she manifests this power, it blinds her and she starts walking into things. In other words, her weaksauce weakness is herself.\n Finally Oni (which in this verse includes devils and vampires) are believed to be vulnerable to boiled beans, but apparently this is only because humans think so.\n The Lunarians are established in the series as a race of extreme intelligence and extreme power whose society is like Gensokyo with its security buffed on steroid. Our heroes tried to invade them twice, with the second only technically succeeding by piles of fake-outs. In Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, the antagonists are easily laying siege on these super-powered immortals - by exploiting their xenophobia through fairies. As fairies brought life to their surrounding nature and life itself is abhorrent to the Lunarians, doubled with Complete Immortality nature of the fairies, they got cornered more and more within their capital with their weapons doing nil on the invading fairies.\n In the SNES The Wizard of Oz game, the Tin Woodman is normally useless, since he can\'t crouch or jump, but his attack is apparently the only one that can hit the Wicked Witch.\n In The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Mothula is generally considered by far the most difficult fight in the game, since it\'s meant to be killed with the fire wand but most players don\'t have enough fuel to get the job done. However, you can deal massive damage if you unleash a bee on him... (It\'s worth noting that this is the only boss fight this tactic will work for, so perhaps the game designers realised how disproportionately difficult it was normally).\n Minecraft\'s final boss, the enderdragon, is extremely difficult to defeat with a sword, and arrows take a long time to bring it down. However, they can be damaged with snowballs, which usually just knock mobs back without hurting them. Since snowballs can be stockpiled easily in a snow biome, and can be thrown much faster than arrows can be shot, they\'re probably the easiest way of winning the fight, and most people would never think to use them since they\'re harmless when used against 95% of the other mobs.\n Endermen are damaged by water. Poor Endermen, caught out in the rain...\n World of Warcraft is rife with such weaknesses to make otherwise impossible encounters winnable or just for amusement value. One great example is a quest where you have to get an artifact to defeat a pack of imps. The effect of this awesome weapon? It creates beautiful rainbows... cue sound of heads exploding.\n In Super Robot Wars Z 2: Saisei-Hen, The DAMON are affected by Basara\'s singing. They even take damage, making Basara a viable choice for fighting against the DAMON.\n In Assassin\'s Creed Revelations, the Janissaries are the toughest enemies in the game by far. Able to survive normally insta-kill kill chains, multiple stab and gunshot injuries, can pull pull out a pistol and shoot you in the face, players learn to loathe them quickly. The fists of an elderly man are the bane of their existence, since chaining 4 unarmed attacks will take them out of commission. Quite depressing when a soldier trained from childhood meets his end from Ezio kicking his nuts twice.\n The Aperture Science security androids in Portal will riddle you with bullets from their bottomless magazines ... unless someone tips them over. Then they plaintively self-destruct.\n For some reason, vampires in the world of BloodRayne are vulnerable to water. Not just holy water or running water, any water at all will burn them. As half-vampires, Rayne is half as vulnerable, but it can still kill her if she\'s fully immersed, or if she stands around in a puddle long enough.\n In Dark Souls, for all its legendary difficulty, you would be absolutely amazed at how many bosses can be killed with Dung Pies. Seriously, you can literally kill some of the strongest bosses by flinging poop at them.\n Played for laughs in Spandex Force when shortly after a Hopeless Boss Fight a surprisingly well-informed little old lady tells your character that according to Science Today its main weakness is coleslaw.\n In The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang, soup is what renders the Freezer vulnerable. Lampshade Hanging emphasizes how absurd this is.\n Wart, Final Boss in Super Mario Bros. 2 has only one weakness. Vegetables. Smacking Wart with veggies isn\'t what hurts him, but the taste alone is vile to him. You force feed Wart until he gives up in defeat.\n The vampires of the Legacy of Kain franchise have the generic weaknesses including one to water; just standing in a heel-deep puddle will quickly burn away at Kain\'s health in Blood Omen 1 and 2, and even after becoming something short of a god, Kain still can\'t be submerged in it in Defiance. Most of the vampire clans have evolved past the sunlight weakness in the thousand years between the first Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, only fledglings and the Rahabim (who evolved to survive in water) are harmed by direct sunlight. Impalement is, at best, a temporary solution, even a vampire that\'s been dead for a thousand years can spring back to life if the object used to impale it is removed unless their body is further destroyed by flame or water.\n Monkey and Secret Army 2 ends with the monkey becoming a superhero to battle the Giant Enemy Crab. He\'s going to beat the crab when it distracts him with bananas. He flies off and is not seen again until chapter 5.\n The Bizarre Adventures Of Woodruff And The Schnibble: Woodruff can repel the Beast from his body by... eating bouzuhouli, an old Bozouk dish.\n War Thunder, being a simulator, realistically deals with most of the idiotic design decisions that plagued the real life tanks. Soviet tanks as a whole struggle to aim down, making them hilariously awful on hilly maps where a German or American tank can just plink at them with impunity from a gully.\n Splatoon: The Kraken special weapon turns the Inkling\'s squid form into a powerful monster that can easily deal with any unprepared opponent by simply jumping at them... unless they\'re standing over a grate, that is. Like the regular squid form, Krakens fall through grates. Best case scenario they just fall to a lower area of the map. Worst case scenario their desperate chase for the opponent makes them fall straight into a Bottomless Pit or become a victim of Super Drowning Skills.\n Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death: Hilariously, Judge Mortis can be fought with cleaning products according to the loading screen, although it\'s not put to the test in the game itself.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Animation\xa0\n Eddsworld: In one of the early Christmas specials Edd is saved form death when he finds the Grim Reaper\'s one weakness: Gravy.\n ASDF Movie: "Kitten Fight!" "No wait, I\'m allergic to adorableness!"\n Tonin: After being made indestructible, Vilano-san is told to avoid dairy. He doesn\'t understand the full implications behind the warning until the hero hits him with a hunk of cheese during Season 1\'s climax. During Season 4, one of his sons tries to obtain that same power in spite of knowing that weakness comes with the package.\n In the second season of XIN, Dimir seems to be an unstoppable combatant. When the eponymous hero realizes he has weak stamina and restricts his movements to conserve it, he\'s beaten like a red-headed stepchild.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n Cheshire Crossing (by the creators of Casey and Andy) delves into the weakness from the The Wizard of Oz: The Wicked Witch of the West explains that all witches are vulnerable to water (while in Oz, at least)\u2014she was keeping the water on hand should Glinda the Good Witch launch a surprise attack. (In a later scene, the bucket is labeled "In case of Glinda".) She just never expected her enemy to bully a little girl into doing the deed.\n Another spoof of The Wizard of Oz comes from Magicians & Munchkins; the Wicked Witch simply took this disadvantage to get a few additional levels in magic.\n It\'s more of a tribute than a spoof, but in Namesake, the Wicked Warlock of the West has the exact same weakness as his predecessor.\n Toothgnip the goat in Goats gets his Kavorka Man powers from "The Panties of Potency". This had nothing to do with the artist having trouble drawing Toothgnip standing on all fours, honest!\n Parodied in this strip of The Order of the Stick, where, since Haley always has her sandwiches without pickles, Crystal thinks they\'re toxic to her.  They\'re not.\n In one Bob the Angry Flower strip, Bob thinks that a superhero has the Weaksauce Weakness of bacon. He turns out to be wrong, but we never find out what the weakness actually is.\n Another one has Bob running a hot peanuts stand, recognizing a customer and his friends as a band of supervillains, and instantly and correctly deducing that they are actually buying ammunition for an attack on Anaphylactic Man\'s fortress. (He sells it to them anyway.)\n Yet another has Bob defeating an evil skeleton with the obscure knowledge that skeletons have a fatal weakness to raisins. Yeah, it\'s that kind of comic.\n This episode of Dinosaur Comics claims to have been inspired by this trope. More specifically, it\'s about the dangers of peanut allergies, orange juice, and the water that takes up 70% of the earth\'s surface.\n Tales of the Questor subverts this with the fey. General belief is that they are vulnerable to "Cold iron" but this proves to be false. Research into why the iron did not work reveals that the ancient documents that the information was obtained from were actually misprinted versions found in an ancient garbage dump and that the symbol for cold and the symbol for north are very similar. Turns out the weakness is not cold iron but "north seeking iron" (lodestone), they are vulnerable to strong magnetic fields. Unfortunately only the weakest fey have this vulnerability, the strong ones can shrug it off (though with immense pain).\n Bob and George: Tomahawk Man is lethally allergic to Plant Shield, something Mega Man considers to be the crummiest power in the series. However, what really takes the cake is Ran Mark II, a monstrosity so intimidating it makes Bob virtually shit his pants. However, he is vulnerable to one of the most common substances in the Bob and George setting: Ran Mk I corpses. Bob, a demigod of fire, is flat fucking terrified of Pok\xe9mon.\n In Goblins: Life Through Their Eyes, Klik, a sentient metallic being able to fly, morph into anything, and absorb genetic information from flesh-based life-forms, is corroded when coming into contact with blood.\n In Sequential Art, the Denizens (little black shadow creatures) are dependent on their leader when they try to conquer the Earth. When he is killed, they just mill around the house, helping out or watching soap operas. And this leader can brandish a chainsaw, but just like the rest of them was small enough to be placed in a drinking glass and thrown out a window. Also, apparently Kat\'s evil former teacher\'s life is somehow linked to the ruler she waves at her students while yelling at them. When Kat breaks it in a fit of anger, the teacher has a heart attack and dies. And There Was Much Rejoicing.\n This trope and the classic superhero Twinkie advertisements are brilliantly parodied in this Super Stupor comic.\n Sluggy Freelance:\n At one point, the bad guys have robotic water-coolers that short circuit on contact with water. Yeah, someone really didn\'t think that one through.\n The Evil, a litter of kittens made invincible, bloodthirsty fiends by Satan still suffer the psychological limitations of being kittens: give them milk, balls of string, or some toy mice, and they\'ll be too distracted and contented to murder you.\n The demons of the Dimension of Pain can\'t stand the smell of flowers. This means that they can\'t enter the sewers in the Dimension of Lame, that place being a real Sugar Bowl.\n In A Girl and Her Fed, the agents with the Pocket President chip installed get incapacitating migraines when exposed to really bright light. It\'s why they all wear the Cool Shades.\n Charby the Vampirate: "Classic" vampires have all the classic weaknesses of the vampires, while "elites" possess none of the weaknesses, save one... Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. If they come across a pile of identical objects (a pile of rice, beans, the beads from a woman\'s dress that had accidentally come apart), they have to count it, regardless of the circumstances. For classic vampires, this can cause them to count until the sun comes up, and they die. For elites, trying to use this on them just ends up pissing them off, since the sun has no effect on them.\n And Elites can still go around that with mathematics: Charby is seen weighting both a small sample and the whole heap on pocket scales, and deducing the total number from the sample size.\n Liz\'s beast-man of a boss in Dead Winter doesn\'t really know how to fight, yet is still able to take on Monday pretty effectively due to his sheer giganticness and indestructibility. Monday stabs him in the shoulder, kicks him in a certain area, etc. but never really fazes him; the heroes end up smashing him in the head with a metal pole attached to a fast-moving car, but this only stuns him temporarily. His weakness? Germs\u2014the imaginary kind. He\'s such a hypochondriac that slapping him in the face with a dirty mop will give him a panic attack. He gets over his fear of zombie infection pretty quickly, though...\n Axe Cop\'s weakness is being surprised. He melts. And his second weakness is cherry rainbow.\n Sydney in Grrl Power has seven orbs that grant her powers. But she has to hold an orb in her hand to use it, so she can only run two powers at a time. When asked what her weakness is, she said:\nSydney: So yeah. Mittens are my kryptonite.\n The robots in Gunnerkrigg Court have the strength and speed of a machine, and some are safe even against Kat\'s electro-disruptor. But they have a big red button on top of their heads. Yep, they have a large, highly visible, easy-to-reach off switch.\n In Rusty and Co.\n The male vampire was killed by a pizza \u2014 not because of the garlic, but because of his gluten intolerance.\n Cube\'s weakness is synthetic fabric.\n And gnolls are vulnerable to dog whistles!\n In Eldritch, while most Eldritch wolves are allergic to silver, any bullet in the heart or head would do them in just as easily.\n In Nodwick, the Evil Sorcerer Ildomir went to a school for wizards called the Heractium Dark Arts Academy, where teachers punished students with a song called "I Write the Spells" (a Song Parody of the pop classic I Write the Songs) which also made them more evil. Unfortunately, this punishment was too much for Ildomir, and ever since, simply hearing the song would drive him to the brink of madness.\n In El Goonish Shive, the fire-summon mooks have a weakness to water, despite not actually being on fire. Trying to make flaming creatures with a summon spell that can\'t allow it (the creatures would incinerate themselves) causes the effect.\n In DNA, Species X can have their powers turned off by getting them wet, especially on the hands, so they can easily be disarmed with squirt guns or sprinklers, although just getting a little mud on their hands doesn\'t seem to affect them.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n In the Whateley Universe, The Fair Folk (and mutants who are turning into Fae) are vulnerable to Cold Iron. Wrought iron benches, cast iron skillets, and so on. But Fey is also vulnerable to synthetic fabrics which give her a burning rash. She could be incapacitated by rayon lingerie! (Or The \'70s.)\n Apparently there is a reviewer that can be destroyed by edutainment games.\n Global Guardians PBEM Universe:\n Plastic, a substance unknown to the Ancient Greeks, is completely opaque to the Mask of Justice\'s vision powers. Thus, he can\'t even see through Saran Wrap (tm) while wearing his mask. (This weakness extends to other substances unknown to the Ancient Greek magicians, but plastic is the one that keeps coming up.)\n Mongibello, a "geokinetic" who can control and move earth and stone, can be rendered powerless simply by picking him up, or otherwise prevent him from touching the ground.\n The Centaurians in The Pentagon War are cold-blooded. They automatically hibernate whenever it gets too chilly.\n Walking City OCT: The Beast, an extremely powerful, assimilating, infectious Eldritch Abomination is vulnerable to Wi-Fi connection, due to also being part-computer virus. As such, the Robot Buddy manages to suck all of The Beast into his system before blowing himself up to take The Beast down with him.\n JonTron discovers that the Scissorman\'s weakness is  a slice of ham, which causes him to dissolve.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n The titular character of Invader Zim is a member of a hyper-advanced, genetically engineered race of aliens for whom Humongous Mechas are a mundane occurrence and whose sole purpose seems to be conquering the entire universe. His main weakness? Water (possibly just polluted water) and meat.\n Captain Planet, being a paragon of clean Earth, is weak against your usual forms of pollution (smog, toxic waste, etc.), as well as Hitler-level hatred, apparently. You might consider these not particularly weaksauce, but it suggests Gaia went seriously wrong in the design stage: the things he was created to fight against are the things that do him the most damage. It\'s like J\'onn J\'onnz deciding to be a firefighter or Alan Scott deciding to only fight evil loggers.\n His evil counterpart Captain Pollution has an even lamer weakness: direct sunlight, lack of pollution, and clean water. Yes, any remotely clean source of drinking water sprayed in his face will make him bow down and crawl helplessly. This seriously deters his ability to establish himself as a credible threat.\n Namor the Sub-Mariner of Marvel Comics is similarly affected by pollution (though not by hate, which is good, since he seems to run on it), but that makes sense, as he\'s a water-breather. Because he\'s a Half-Human Hybrid, he\'s also subject to insanity and fits of rage if he stays submerged for more than two weeks. Or emerged for more than two weeks. So he needed to switch environment every week to stay sane. Until authors simply forgot the issue.\n Yin Yang Yo!\n The only thing that prevents Brother Herman from taking over the world is the fact the he\'s allergic to panda fur. As long as Master Yo, the last panda on the planet, is around, failure will be his only option.\n His brother Carl, The Evil Cockroach Wizard has been shown to be a very powerful villain capable of global domination himself, he has one glaring weakness: self-esteem. He\'s been defeated by insults and peer pressure, and his own low opinion of himself keeps him from going full-tilt against the heroes and his brother.\n Birdman from the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons had the powers of flight, energy beams that shot from his hands, enhanced strength, and a personal force field \u2014 and drew his powers from the light of the sun. Fair enough, there are plenty of other solar-powered heroes out there (Superman, Cyclops (sometimes), Starfire). Unlike those heroes, however, Birdman apparently had no energy reserve; he became weak as a baby after being removed from sunlight for less than a minute. As it was implied that being out of the sun for an extended period of time ("extended" apparently being something like five minutes) was fatal to Birdman, it\'s a wonder he didn\'t spontaneously drop dead at night. No wonder he became a lawyer. After he became a lawyer, he developed a new Weaksauce Weakness; he\'s completely worthless if he loses the Birdman insignia that he keeps on his forehead.\n In an episode of Ben 10, it turns out that the leader of the Galactic Enforcers (an alien superhero team, said leader an obvious parody of Superman) has a devastating weakness to chocolate, which Ben himself points out is a lame superweakness.\n The members of the Sushi Pack are rendered powerless by any kind of heat, but even worse, they feel compelled to announce this every time a villain pulls out a heat lamp.\n WordGirl isn\'t so much defeated by a cute little kitten, but rather easily distracted by one. She also compensates for her language abilities by showing a complete lack of competence in art, poetry, and dance.\n Parodied in Futurama: "The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!"\n "Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever splash on meeeee!?"\n An episode of Martin Mystery had an alien fungus monster that had taken over a small town and replaced the inhabitants with clones. Both it and the clones could be killed with salt. As luck would have it, the small town just happened to be in northern Utah.\n Mumm-Ra from Thunder Cats, with a weakness to his own reflection. The writers eventually realized this made Mumm-Ra too lame, so they had him get over it. The Thundercats had a harder time dealing with him after that. Even more so when he got an Infinity+1 Sword of his own.\n Plutar was weakened by soap. The show was so far in the future that modern society was all but forgotten; soap was treated as an ancient science.\n The Powerpuff Girls\n When Buttercup wanted to become a better superhero in "Super Zeroes", she became Mange, a knockoff of Darker and Edgier comic book Anti Heroes \u2014 Spawn in particular. However, when the time came for her and her sisters (both of whom also assumed their own "better superhero" identities) to go out and fight a monster destroying Townsville, Mange was the only one who stayed behind, saying it\'s too bright and that she only travels at night. Mange then spent the rest of the day sitting on the couch with Professor Utonium until night fell, arriving too late at the scene as the monster had already left (her sisters were also late for reasons of their own). The three girls spent the night under a tree. When the monster came back to face the girls again, Mange sits out the fight, preferring to stay under the tree\'s shade. This attitude led the monster to eventually call her "Little Miss Darkness who\x92s afraid of a little sun".\n Being kindergarteners, the girls have plenty of weaknesses of their own any other time\u2014they have been shown to be deathly afraid of "cooties", cockroaches, and broccoli. The episodes these weaknesses show up in usually involve some sort of super-powered or evil version of it, so it\'s not always so silly...\n There\'s Antidote X which was used in only one television episode ("Slumbering With The Enemy", on the girls themselves) and in the movie (on Mojo Jojo).\n Mojo also tried to use it in another episode where he also used Chemical X to give his then-partner Princess super-powers. Unfortunately, this backfired on both villains, and Princess was hit with the Antidote X, letting the Girl trounce them both.\n The original incarnation of their Spear Counterpart enemies the RowdyRuff Boys are so grossed out by the girls\' kisses that they explode. And after being genetically modified to actually gain strength from this past weakness ( aka puberty), they gain a new weakness,  humiliation. Yes, humiliation. Anytime they are embarrassed and laughed at, they shrink.\n Gargoyles\n The titular creatures turn into immobile statues during the day, which leaves them extremely vulnerable. They try to work around this in various ways (working a deal with humans in exchange for protection, magic spells, etc.) However, this is actually a bit of a double-edged sword. Though vulnerable as stone statues, they are COMPLETELY healed of almost ANY wounds (even potentially fatal ones) when they return to flesh and blood. Hudson, being the most experienced of the main cast, uses this to his advantage, defeating the better armed and fitter Demona while protecting an injured Goliath by simply keeping her at bay until dawn. When the sun sets, Goliath is healed and they easily dispatch her together.\n Oberon\'s Children, like other portrayals of The Fair Folk, are all vulnerable to iron. Iron can disrupt their magic, actually hurt them, and imprison them. In his  not really first appearance, Puck is forced to obey Demona after being bound with iron chains. The Weird Sisters are also coerced into doing a favor in exchange for being released from an iron chain. Later, The Trickster Coyote is trapped in the robot Coyote\'s latest body which was constructed with iron from a magical cauldron. Their ruler Oberon, while not immune to iron, is powerful enough to withstand being impaled by an iron harpoon though it does cause him to wither in appearance for a short time.  (An Iron bell on the other hand, can easily kill him.)\n One episode of My Life as a Teenage Robot has an incredibly powerful, sadistic, and sexist supervillain, Himcules, who gets stronger and stronger anytime he causes someone pain, and of course, he appears right after Jenny has implanted sensors in herself that either tickles herself or causes her pain. Stuck in "Pain" mode, Himcules continues to gain more and more muscle (and even pleasure) every second he makes her cry in pain... then she comes upon a little girl who kindly (sorta) switches her "Pain" switch to "Tickle", and it just so happens that laughing at Himcules is his only weakness.\n In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward Sh\'Okanabo\'s first attempt to infect Earth with his progeny is thwarted by...sunlight. Although this is handwaved as a particular, unexpected feature of Earth\'s, and Sh\'Okanabo himself is not normally affected, dealing with his weakness is the thrust of his character arc throughout the remainder of the season.\n In one episode of The BOTS Master, the Big Bad uses a special alloy to make his Mecha-Mooks Nigh Invulnerable. The good guys think that they\'re screwed, until the inventor of the alloy tells them that the alloy can be dissolved by...citric acid. In the end they use lemon juice to defeat the new Mecha-Mooks.\n Kim Possible\n Felix Renton\'s Super Wheelchair is one of the most advanced pieces of technology in the series. It can hover and has Combat Tentacles. But it can be hijacked by a wireless game controller.\n One of Dr. Drakken\'s schemes was to create an army of Kim Possible clones. The scheme failed when Wade figured out that the clones were chemically unstable and would melt if exposed to carbonated soda.\n In So The Drama, Drakken created a synthodrone that could pass for human. It blocked Kim\'s last-ditch attempt to stop Drakken... until one bite from Rufus drained its synthogoo and destroyed it.\n Darkwing Duck\n Not exactly canon, but when he retells his origins in "The Secret Origin of Darkwing Duck," he describes meeting another hero whose weakness is Coo-koo Cola. She winds up falling into a vat of the stuff at a factory and, well ... adds to the Disney series\' death count. Then again that story\'s complete baloney (to name but one problem, that hero was played by Gosalyn and Launchpad was her sidekick, neither of whom Darkwing met until after he\'d been a hero for a while already), so it doesn\'t really count.\n There\'s also Comet Guy (Super Weight: 4), whose Achilles\' Heel is that every time he hears the sound of a bell, he starts dancing mindlessly until he hears a whistle. His intellect might also count, but frankly it probably can\'t even do 2+2.\n The Fairly OddParents: All that fairy magic is neutralized when they are under a butterfly net. There\'s also all the various "Da Rules" which prevent them from undoing some of the more disastrous wishes, but do nothing to stop them from getting into these situations to begin with. One thinks an "I wish that no wishes that will somehow prevent me from undoing those wishes can be cast" wish might save a lot of trouble.\n SpongeBob SquarePants\n The alien jellyfish in the episode, "Planet of the Jellyfish", dissolve into puddles of goop upon contact with mayonnaise.\n One of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy\'s antagonists is the Dirty Bubble, who is... a bubble. Go ahead, guess a weakness.\n Codename: Kids Next Door: The Kids overcome Father\'s pyrokinesis by drenching him in ice cream. (Oddly enough, he still eats it from time to time, especially when he\'s depressed.)\n Danny Phantom\n Desiree\'s main weakness is that she has to grant every wish she hears, including wishes like "I wish you were defeated."\n The Fright Knight is also stupidly vulnerable. If his sword gets sheathed in a pumpkin, he is instantly defeated. His worst nightmare is probably somebody using an ordinary pumpkin as a shield.\n Mighty Ray of Hero 108 has the ability to shoot lightning from his eyes. The drawback is that he has to eat a banana to do it...and he hates bananas. He can also have his eyes knocked out of his head, which happens more often than you\'d like to think.\n Several characters from CatDog refer to this trope as "Porkfat", named after the weaksauce weakness of the in-universe movie character, Mean Bob.\n Bureau of Alien Detectors: When making an unstoppable zombie army, it\'s a good idea to ensure that the one thing that will kill them doesn\'t exist naturally in the atmosphere. Oxygen.\n Jimmy Two-Shoes: According to Word of God, Lucius actually has some pretty terrifying powers, including Reality Warper abilities. The sole reason he doesn\'t use them is because his pride would be wounded if he admitted he needed them. Without them, he becomes a rather Harmless Villain.\n According to God, the Devil and Bob, Satan can\'t stand Tony Orlando songs. This comes in handy the one time he actually tries to knock off the comedy routine and physically attack Bob.\n Ben 10: Ultimate Alien features in one episode an otherwise-invulnerable plant monster that dissolves on contact with... peanuts. No explanation is given beyond "it\'s allergic".\n The Imperium, White Martian expys in Justice League have an even greater weakness than the usual fire. Direct sunlight causes them to burn and evaporate near instantly. One would think they\'d be moving along planet systems away from suns, but no.\n Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil\n Not only is vampires\' weakness to sunlight so great that they can be turned to dust by UV fluorescent lights, but they\'re deathly afraid of balloons.\n And when Senator Whitehead turns into a giant monster, his weakness is beatboxing.\n The second act of the Mr. Bogus episode "Totally Bogus Video" showed that the Dirt Dudes are vulnerable to fruit punch, as it causes them to melt when it comes in contact with them, a la the Wicked Witch of the West.\n The controversial Looney Tunes short "Wagon Heels" features Injun Joe, The Superchief as its villain. Injun Joe is a powerhouse: he shatters mountains and laughs at gunfire. But Porky Pig\'s sidekick Sloppy Moe knows Injun Joe\'s secret weakness. He\'s ticklish!\n If SheZow gets her hair messed up, she loses her power \u2014 fortunately for her, she has a can of hair spray in the Beautility Belt to fix this.\n In Batman Beyond, the assassin Inque is vulnerable to: water, electricity, severe cold, and dehydration. Despite this, she\'s likely the strongest villain in the series (in terms of physical power), who has likely come closer to killing Terry than anyone else (even his Arch-Enemy Blight), and while he has defeated her, he has always needed help from someone else to do so.\n In The Transformers, the Decepticons were once driven off by a fire suppression system that sprayed them with fire-retardant foam after Megatron claimed it would short out their circuits. Why this doesn\'t make Inferno and Hot Spot (Autobots who turn into fire trucks) into the Decepticons\' primary nemeses has never been explored.\n In what may be a weird mixture of Call Back and Running Gag, Sideways in Transformers Cybertron and Starscream and Blackarachnia in Transformers Animated have also been incapacitated by fire-retardant foam for varying lengths of time. This includes the foam from a traditional human-sized fire extinguisher, in the case of Sideways.\n In the Talespin episode, "Pizza Pie in the Sky", the normally healthy and active Louie is severely allergic to anchovies. One whiff of the irregular anchovies that Baloo and Kit bring him is enough to make him ill and delusional.\n Parodied in an episode of Freakazoid!, where Gutierrez confronts Freakazoid armed with a small collection of famous Weaksauce Weaknesses like a chunk of kryptonite, a gold card and a glass of water. Then he finds out that his weakness is actually graphite bars charged with negative ions. And "poo-gas" (but then again, nobody likes poo-gas.)\n Avatar: The Last Airbender: Element-bending is basically Supernatural Martial Arts combined with Elemental Punch, meaning that you can stop the craziest of superpowered benders by tying up their hands and legs. Though there are those with whom even that won\'t work  (Aang can blow people away with a sneeze, Iroh and Korra can breathe fire, Bumi can earthbend with his face, Yakone and Noatak have demonstrated psychic bloodbending, Combustion Man and P\'li can blow things up by thinking at them, and Ming-Hua can waterbend despite having no arms.\n In the season 4 premiere of Jackie Chan Adventures, Tohru threw an onion at Tarakudo on the strength of his mother\'s fairy tales about onions repelling oni. Tarakudo screamed about his eyes burning and vanished. Several episodes in we get Jade digging an onion out of a dumpster.\nTarakudo: No! Anything but onions! (Jade throws it at him.) My eyes! My eyes! (poof)\n A one off villain could be turned to stone if exposed to salt.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Real Life\xa0\n Any human being, no matter their condition or how healthy they are, are at risk of Commotio Cordis (agitation of the heart). This requires being hit in the chest over the heart at the right point of a heartbeat. Only a few dozen cases are reported per year, but victims are almost guaranteed to die if it happens (survival rate is 35% ... if the victim is treated in three minutes). Even a gentle blow that doesn\'t bruise the skin can trigger commotio cordis\u2014which means every time you get hit in the chest, you\'re playing Russian Roulette. Even worse, it\'s most common in teenage boys, usually while playing sports...\n Allergies. Nuts, animals, shellfish, bananas...in the case of peanut allergies, some cases are so severe that people could be in serious danger just by being in the same room as peanuts.\n Some people suffer from Aquagenic Urticaria (water allergy). That\'s right, there\'s people who were unfortunate enough to be born allergic to a substance they can\'t live without. Any moisture build up on their skin aggravates the condition, so they must carry umbrellas with them at all times, avoid heavy clothing/exercise to prevent sweating and prefer to remain indoors in well ventilated surroundings. For all their precautions, though, they still have to wash themselves with water regularly.\n There\'s a lot of stuff that can incapacitate a human. Tickling is a lot of peoples\' weaknesses and a lot of people have a sound that \'goes through them\' like the sound of plastic folders being rubbed or nails on a blackboard.\n The right pattern of flashing lights can cause nausea in any human, people with epilepsy simply have a more severe reaction. This has since been weaponized And now you can build your own.\n The skins of land snails and slugs are water permeable, and as such, are extremely vulnerable to fatally drying out. It\'s also why they\'re limited to dark, moist environments. Salt kills land snails and slugs by screwing up their osmotic balance, in that the salt speeds up the drying process by pulling the water inside of their cells and internal organs out.\n Giraffes can easily suffer fatal neck and head injuries just from falling over. Don\'t believe it? Just imagine the whiplash with a neck that long... This is true of most large animals\u2014the bigger you are, the worse falling over is for you. That\'s why, for example, elephants keep at least 3 legs on the ground when running (rearing up on their hind legs, as is sometimes seen in circuses, is not a natural behavior). Gravity is a bitch.\n Most electronic devices can be damaged irreparably by brief contact with water.\n It isn\'t the water that kills it. All electronics are only good up to a certain voltage or current. Go beyond the specification of a given part for either and it goes boom. Water simply provides a method of short circuiting the gadget, thus bringing the current over what the electronic likes, usually. If you dunked a cellphone (without the battery) in water and let it dry for a day or two, it could still operate. Wouldn\'t recommend you try it though.\n In fact, the best way to clean your keyboard if it can take the abuse? Run it through the dishwasher.\n When an electric device has become wet it can be dried quicker by first dunking it in another fluid (that may or may not be able to shortcircuit the electronics by conducting electricity itself) with a lower boiling point. This fluid will replace most of the water in the device and afterwards evaporate quicker, leaving the device dry and ready to use sooner.\n Static electricity can do this as well if you touch electronic components directly while carrying a charge in your body. Your desktop can be murdered by your carpet.\n Modern electronics are often powered by Lithium-Ion batteries because of their high charge speed, stable voltage and limited charge decay. Problem is that lithium catches fire in contact with water. A damaged battery must be discarded immediately. This is applicable for electric cars as well - battery fire has destroyed a fair deal of vehicles that way.\n Aircraft that employ stealth technologies can very easily lose their stealthiness to the most mundane of things.\n The F-22 "Raptor" is one of the most advanced stealth fighters in the world. Yet the radar-absorbent coating can be easily damaged by water, significantly increasing its visibility to radar.\n The F-117 Nighthawk, the world\'s first stealth fighter, had a radar-absorbent coating that would be ruined by just leaving fingerprints.\n Some people with PTSD have triggers of the Nightmare Retardant variety that, out of context, seem laughable to those who aren\'t triggered by them, but remind them in some way of their traumatic experience and can trigger anything from an uncomfortable sensation to a full-blown flashback of the event. To make things worse, people with this kind of trigger will sometimes experience belittlement if they dare to disclose it.\n Worse is the way Kryptonite Is Everywhere; people could understand if a loud bang causes someone who\'d been in a war zone to flash back to a bomb strike, but what if a certain enemy vehicle sounded a lot like a certain civilian one, or someone was holding a cup of McDonald\'s coffee just before the worst attack they\'d lived through? Suddenly a car in need of a tune-up or a cup of coffee on a table is Kryptonite to a Colonel Badass who eats nails for breakfast. One could also easily imagine a person who has suffered abuse needing to, say, not watch Law & Order: Special Victims Unit if they\'d been molested. But some could watch it all day, and then the mailman comes by wearing the same brand and color of shoes their abuser preferred.\n Diabetics have sugar. Too much AND too little.\n Albinos have sunlight.\n A couple of other disorders too, including xeroderma pigmentosum.\n The RIAA came up with a brilliant new method for encrypting data on CDs, which works fine on PC computers, but not on Macintoshes. It can be negated by drawing a circle on the CD with permanent marker.\n Optical discs themselves (especially those which have two shiny sides) have a Weaksauce Weakness - simple tape. If one pastes tape or a label on the front of some discs, then decides to remove the tape or label, the adhesive peels off the data-containing foil layer, rendering the disc unusable. This is because the disc has almost nothing between the foil and the label side of the disc. The fact that the disc is shiny on the label side as well as the data side shows that the disc has no protective label printed onto it, only a thin layer of plastic that is easily removed. In fact, any optical disc is much more likely to be ruined from the label side than the data side because of the thinness of that side, even with a factory-printed label.\n Phobias in general can be like this for those who suffer from them; they cause crippling, irrational panic at the slightest indication of the feared objects. Worse, being irrational after all, the object doesn\'t even have to be objectively frightening. Most of us can probably understand why people would be afraid of spiders, or snakes, or heights, but imagine having a phobia of flowers, buttons, or peanut butter? (Imagine it too hard and you\'ll get phobophobia...)\n Laser weapons that are starting to be used by the US military can be thwarted by such phenomena as dust, sand, bad weather, clouds, smoke, steam, etc. As Stephen Colbert put it, it\'s a good thing they\'re not planning on using it in regions that have above-mentioned problems, or if Iran develops sand technology.\n People can pass out by locking their knees for too long. This isn\'t normally a problem, but people who have to stand still for long periods of time, such as people in the army, marching band, or choir, have to make sure to bend their knees occasionally.\n Animals with strong clamping muscles, such as crocodiles or lobsters, tend to have weak muscles for opening. Their main weapon, whether it\'s a mouth or a claw, can be rendered useless by a rubber band.\n Elephants are afraid of mice. At least in cartoons. The scientific jury is still undecided whether this has a sound real-life basis or whether it is just an Urban Legend.\n Mythbusters tested it and found it confirmed: elephants will actively avoid mice if at all possible. Though it\'s not specifically mice so much as it is wariness at something smaller than an elephant\'s poor eyesight can reliably identify, to them it could be a snake or something else potentially threatening.\n Tin foil can easily destroy a microwave oven.\n Microwaves can interfere with Wi-Fi signals.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/weaksauce-weakness_captain-enviro_3760.png', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EighthMan', u'titleofwork': u'8th Man'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure', u'titleofwork': u"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers', u'titleofwork': u'Slayers'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece', u'titleofwork': u'One Piece'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie', u'titleofwork': u'Read or Dream'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross', u'titleofwork': u'Macross'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross', u'titleofwork': u'Super Dimension Fortress Macross'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7', u'titleofwork': u'Macross 7'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire', u'titleofwork': u'Rosario + Vampire'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf', u'titleofwork': u'Ranma \xbd'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool', u'titleofwork': u'Cromartie High School'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail', u'titleofwork': u'Fairy Tail'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach', u'titleofwork': u'Bleach'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist', u'titleofwork': u'Fullmetal Alchemist'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto', u'titleofwork': u'Naruto'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Needless', u'titleofwork': u'NEEDLESS'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa', u'titleofwork': u'Kirby: Right Back at Ya!'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann', u'titleofwork': u'Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyriadColorsPhantomWorld', u'titleofwork': u'Myriad Colors Phantom World'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess', u'titleofwork': u'Ah!
