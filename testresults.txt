There are only extremely girly men! And I am the girliest of them all! Pegasus: Keep telling yourself that.\n\u2014 Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series\n\n\nAn array of pretty people as eye candy isn\'t just for the guys. Girls get their Cast Full of Pretty Boys to ogle too in the name of fanservice. This tends to be less noticeable than its female counterpart because exclusively (or near-exclusively) male casts are already common and expected (thought not always with the intentional appeal to females) and the fanservice tends to be along the lines of "he cooks" or "naked chest" and thus usually objectifies in a different way than in male-oriented shows\u2014unless there are Yaoi Guys involved. The writers sometimes leave it to their audience to retrofit the standard group of friends into the Unwanted Harem if they wish.\nSome series of this flavor go the reverse harem route and have an ordinary female lead among the Pretty Boys as an audience surrogate, although the girly keet type can be used this way too.\nSometimes these stories have their own version of Those Two Guys. One will be a \'normal\' audience surrogate and thus a young (but non-threatening) girl. Another will be a more \'ideal\' woman, often a clever, sexy, and mature lady who barely fits into her dress.\nCompare and contrast Improbably Female Cast, Otokonoko Genre.\n\nExamples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime & Manga\xa0\n Free! has a cast that, by far, only consists of five attractive and well built male swimmers.\n And season 2 introduces a new set of pretty boys in addition to the old cast.\n It should be noted that this is a common trope for many sports related anime. Haikyuu!! and Kuroko no Basuke are also good examples of this trope.\n Most of the guys in Durarara!! could qualify. There are exceptions, but most of the male cast is rather pretty.\n Black Butler takes this to Up to Eleven levels. Nearly every damn single male character is an outright bishounen, with few exceptions. There are a few female characters, but most of them are either one arc wonders, dead, or only recurring. Or they\'re there to fangirl over the hotness of our protagonist, Sebastian.\n Jump ahead to the school arc of the manga. Ciel enrolls into an all boy\'s school and nary a woman is to be seen. What few women do show up are unimportant background characters with little to say and zero fanservice to provide any male readers who didn\'t abandon the series after season 2 of the anime. We do however get a large new cast of attractive teen boys.\n Several CLAMP series, especially Clamp School Detectives, X1999 and Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.\n Amatsuki: Plenty of good-looking male characters for the fans to enjoy, both human and non-human. The artist lampshaded this by doing a Gender Flip chapter special without changing the guys\' faces.\n In the 2013 The Anime of the Game Amnesia (Otome), the entire plot revolves around a group of simply gorgeous young men, all of whom are interested in the heroine.\n Axis Powers Hetalia. All of the main characters, the Axis 3 and the 5 Allies, are young men. The main reason for this? The author has trouble drawing women. Ironically, many of the main characters were initially meant to be middle-aged. The first and most prominent female character is Hungary, who appears in the center of the volume 5 cover. It\'s probably not a coincidence that\'s she\'s a fujoshi. She is not the female audience surrogate, however; Seychelles was made for that purpose.\n Beyblade and its Spin-Off Metal Fight Beyblade has a rather disproportionate amount of pretty underage boys for a show about spinning tops, most likely to attract girls who otherwise wouldn\'t have given the show\'s premise a second thought.\n Black Blood Brothers proves that being hot and being a vampire are not exclusive.\n When the werewolf big guy is a Bishonen, you are definitely here.\n Black Cat: Filled to the brim with good lookin\' guys. You can count the non-pretty characters on one hand, and none of them are prominent.\n Although Chrono Crusade has quite a bit of fanservice based around its mostly female True Companions, it\'s not hard to notice that every single important male character is very good looking, and these characters probably have as many Shirtless Scenes as the girls have Clothing Damage scenes, if not more. Obviously, the manga-ka knew how to widen his demographic.\n Descendants of Darkness: The average female character has the life expectancy of a particularly stupid gnat or falls off the face of the earth after one or two appearances, and only one major character is not bishonen. And we should be glad: apparently Ukyou (Muraki\'s consensual Love Interest) actually appears in a short the author did at the publisher\'s request, and turned out to be a mystic trouble magnet with so much trauma she\'s afraid of all men and some kind of growth deficiency so she looks like a little girl. Not what the references to her led us to expect.\n Fruits Basket, while having several plot-worthy female characters other than the lead in the manga, spends a disproportionate amount of its time on Yuki and Kyo. The rest of the cast is also heavily bishonen. Also see Harem Genre.\n Fushigi Yuugi has them littered everywhere. Miaka, the main character, has a personal harem of them. Yui gets Nakago, and Nakago gets... everybody else, at some point or another in the story.\n Also in the "shounen manga for girls" category, Get Backers dishes up plenty of Fanservice in the form of scantily clad women with impossibly huge boobs, the series still appeals to some girls who are attracted by the predominantly bishounen cast.\n Gravitation, Gakuen Heaven, and any other Boys Love series.\n Taken to a ridiculous extreme in Sukisho. There are no female characters in the entire show, and all characters are either bishonen, handsome men in their 30s, or young boys, and one crossdresser housewife. There is one single woman in the background who is visible for about half a second, and one character mentions his mother in one scene.\n Similarly occurs in the Saint Beast prequel series. There are no women in heaven apparently\u2014those pretty youths with female names? Male. Rei too.\n Togainu no Chi: All Igura participants are male; all of them. In fact, the city of Toshima seems to have no female inhabitants.\n Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is considered a Cast Full of Pretty Boys among its female audience, despite the fact that it is not only a shounen series, but has a deliberate 1:1 ratio of male to female main characters and more or less assigns one female to each male.\n Hana-Kimi is about a girl disguising herself as a man so she can get into an all-boys school. Obviously, most of the cast are bishounen.\n Hunter \xd7 Hunter. There\'s so few women per story arc that you can count them on one hand.\n That said, there tends to be a wide variety of character types with only a handful of bishonen among them, and sometimes it\'s really hard to tell which characters are which gender.\n Except for a few deliberately ugly characters, Parts 4, 5, and 7 of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure are full of very feminine/androgynous male characters. (Part 6 takes place in a women\'s prison). Part 2 is more like a Cast Full of Shirtless Hunks.\n Karneval: Most of the male cast could qualify.\n Shonen Jump title Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has Tsuna and his guardians. Plus the side characters. Plus 99% of the villains. In fact, the number of times there is fanservice for guys can be counted on one hand.\n Kimi to Boku centers on a group of bishounen childhood friends, especially the twins Yuki and Yuta.\n Kyo Kara Maoh!, complete with Those Two Girls: the flirty curvy ex-Maou Cheri and the younger inventor Anasina, sometimes joined by a trio of servants who are essentially fangirls themselves. (They write yaoi fanfic about their employers!)\n Yuuri even has an Unwanted Harem, and he\'s actually engaged to one of them! He pretty steadfastly ignores it, though he also gets visible man-crushes on at least one, possibly two pretty guys.\n 95% of La Corda d\'Oro\'s main characters are male and pretty.\n Love Mode: Nothing but good-looking guys.\n Junjou Romantica. Understandable, since it\'s a BL series.\n Les Mis\xe9rables: Sh\u014djo Cosette has almost all of The Friends of the ABC. The exceptions are Grantaire and Lesgle, but their appearance was upgraded.\n Nabari no Ou: Every major and minor male character under 30 is Bish\u014dnen. No exceptions.\n Ouran High School Host Club plays with this, along with Haruhi\'s crossdressing letting girls gush over her too.\n Pandora Hearts is a textbook example of this.\n Papuwa has only one human female character, and she\'s... Let\'s just say she is six feet tall, over muscled, and has a beard. The rest of the cast are animals and attractive men.\n Peacemaker Kurogane: Most of the cast is male and Bish\u014dnen and Ho Yay is rampant. The only identifiable females are Saya and Susumu\'s sister.\n Pr\xe9tear, created entirely on the premise of combining a Magical Girl anime with a male Unwanted Harem. Even if a few of them are far too young to be bishonen yet, they are clearly meant to be bishonen in training and before the series started, they * were* bishonen until they were killed by the villain.\n It\'s very easy to confuse The Prince of Tennis for a Boys Love series due to its largely male cast and mostly Yaoi Fangirl following. Actually it\'s a shonen manga and anime, however, it\'s a very fine example of the increasingly prevalent Bishonen Jump Syndrome (and what a surprise, Prince of Tennis happens to be serialized in Shounen Jump).\n Ronin Warriors, wherein maybe two of the main characters are women, and every male is prettier than you or your girlfriend.\n Arguably, Masami Kurumada as the author of Saint Seiya popularized this. After all, who else would have the guts to name a man Aphrodite?\n His next big work, B\'t X is even more into this trope. Because as vaguely homoerotic as it was when Shun revived Hyoga by cuddling up to him, nothing surpasses the bishieness of Demon Knight Sapphire. Because really, he himself says he\'s really into "what\'s hot and what\'s not" and goes so far as to kiss Teppei.\n Fou and Quattro\u2014 born in Sodom, died in Sodom!\n CLAMP started off drawing Saint Seiya doujinshi (there\'s still some of it online, I think) and the fandom actually consolidated the use of the word \'yaoi\' in the 80s. It also has only one instance of female fanservice in the entire thing (although this is not so in Next Dimension)-compared to the amount of times we see Shiryu shirtless and Saga naked...it\'s certainly one of the best examples of this trope.\n Saiyuki: The basic series premise is not \'A loose retelling of Journey to the West.\' It\'s \'Throw three hot guys and their cute surrogate little brother in a small jeep and watch the fireworks.\' The only significant female characters are Lirin and Yaone. Yaone was added in to increase the number of girls and in one volume a note from Minekura at the end states: "There are no women in this volume, I looked back and found a couple of pages with Kannon." As for Kanzeon? Close but no cigar.\n Saiunkoku Monogatari has the heroine making friends with dozens of gorgeous Long Haired Pretty Boys. If there\'s one thing to be said about the series, it\'s that it\'s very, very pretty.\n Since it\'s by the woman who practically invented Yaoi, Toward the Terra already had a fair share of pretty boys in manga form. Then someone decided to adapt it into an anime and put Nobuteru Y\u016bki (aka, the man responsible for the bishonen overload in Vision of Escaflowne) in charge of the character designs. The end result is that there are simply no ugly men in this series. At all.\n Every speaking male in Tokyo Mew Mew is on eye candy. Take your arguably Stripperiffic Teen Genius, your amazing dessert chef with the red sports car, your murderous alien, or your perfect boyfriend. Were we supposed to be watching the show for strong female characters or environmentalism? Hmm...\n Trigun borders on this, as almost all of the major male characters are attractive bishonen, including Vash, Knives, Wolfwood, Legato, etc.\n It also has Those Two Girls, in the form of Meryl and Millie, though neither of them does the curvaceous thing. One-shot characters handle that. Like the Stripperific engineer, Miss Elizabeth, and the undercover sheriff, Miss Aurelie.\n Vampire Doll: All of the men are gorgeous flamboyant eyecandy who lay on heavy fanservice. What few girls in the series are adorable too.\n Vampire Knight: While it has its female characters, the cast is predominantly made up of very pretty boys. Even the headmaster could be considered bishonen.\n Not even The Vision of Escaflowne escapes this treatment. Though Van isn\'t super girly he is still very handsome; Allen, on the other hand....\n The Wallflower: Each member of the unwanted harem is a liberal user of Bishie Sparkle.\n Wei\xdf Kreuz: Arguably the biggest draw despite its poor animation quality and plot holes large enough to drive a tank through, its four angsty, sexually ambiguous bishonen have garnered a wide fandom.\n Marvel Comics has made several attempts to court manga readers, both Japanese and Western. Their latest attempt is OEL X-Men Shoujo manga entitled X-Men: Misfits. In this manga, Kitty Pryde, the Audience Surrogate character, is the first female to enroll at Xavier\'s for a very long time and thus surrounded by an Unwanted Harem composed entirely of bishonen. Poor Kitty. Submitted for your horror and/or squee; the Hellfire Club. Other exhibits include Bishie Iceman, Bishie Nightcrawler and Not-So-Bishie Bishie Wolverine (who looks like Bill Kaulitz!). Also included is Bishie Gambit (at least somewhat justified given Gambit has always been fangirl bait), who apparently is the resident Goth/Industrial fan. Kurt is unusually human-looking in this title.\n As the page quote states, almost all the characters on Yu-Gi-Oh! are men, and most are either feminine or American, sometimes both. The best evidence of this is the Marik\'s Evil Council videos, where all the villains appear in succession, and aside from Zorc and possibly Akun (or Bob), ALL of them are incredibly bishonen. It\'s even more obvious in the other two. Latter has emphasis on the Ghetto.\n YuYu Hakusho is another great example: while the central True Companions gender ratio is almost 50/50, the focus is overwhelmingly on guys, many of whom are quite Bishounen. The big exception is Kuwabara, but damn if he doesn\'t make up for that with his great physique! This was not at all the case back when the premise was \'dead delinquent having heart-warming yet hilarious ghostly adventures\', when the main characters were Yusuke and Botan, with Keiko and then Kuwabara becoming increasingly important, and also Shota who appeared twice and Sayaka the ghost girl who joined up for a while.\n 07-Ghost main cast has only males, with only a few women on the side. Not only that, but every male character who isn\'t a geezer is *fabulous* , and good looks are apparently required to be a bishop. Then there\'s all the rampant Ho Yay...\n The only female characters in any given episode of Miracle Train are Akari and the Passenger of The Week.\n Almost the same applies to Marginal Prince (where the character design comes from the same person as the series above): the only reoccuring female characters are relatives of the main characters (sisters or mothers) and all of them are faceless.\n Corsair\'s cast, with the exception of Barbossa is very much this, plus Aura and Katarina to fill the beautiful women quota. Seen here. There\'s a reason for this.\n Betrayal Knows My Name: Every character is a bishonen.\n InuYasha has this in spades. note\xa0If you\'ve been reading The TV Tropes Wiki Drinking Game, take a swig. If the character is central to the plot and male, he will be Bishonen.\n Boys Love Ai no Kusabi due to there being very few women on the planet it takes place and much of the population being the product of LEGO Genetics.\n Number: It\'s easier to list the female characters: two look like four-year-olds  and one of them is the enemy leader; one\'s a Ninja Maid Cold Sniper who might be an artificial human (she\'s certainly treated like one); one\'s a really well-endowed hermaphrodite who killed herself trying to take down an enemy, and her little gal-pal  is actually a boy. There\'s also the main character\'s dead mom and sister.\n The only male characters who aren\'t bishounen are the Number assassins\' corrupt targets (we only see two of them before the plot kicks in) and the ninja-maid\'s master, who\'s a Frank Booth-level sadist (minus the drugs (probably)). The rest of the handsome/pretty cast love to torment the handsome/pretty teenage main protagonist.\n School Teacher has a small classroom of cute/pretty boys who are actually animals trying to become human (tsundere fox, horny rabbit, hyperactive squirrel twins, and very eager-to-please puppy; the puppy thought the teacher was a parrot due to his red hair and later declares that he "will be sensei\'s wife!"). The two exceptions to the all-male cast are  the sexy oujo-sama cat with full lips, long hair, and female kimono who\'s actually a neutered male and the woman who had a crush on his master who only appears in flashback.\n Marginal Prince, it\'s based on a Romance Game after all. In fact, there isn\'t a single reocurring female character except for Yuuta\'s faceless older sister (who serves as an Audience Surrogate ).\n The Legend of Sun Knight. So much so that you could say it feels off when they tone down the copious amount of Bishie Sparkle after the first couple chapters.\n K. Large, almost entirely male cast, all of them pretty.\n Undertaker Riddle. The male/female radio is 1 female for 5 males, all of them pretty.\n Di[e]ce. There\'s only one significant female character. The rest of the cast consists of pretty, pretty Bish\u014dnen.\n In Kamisama Kiss nearly every male in the series is on a sliding scale of attractive that ranges from cute boy lolita to full-on Bishounen. If he isn\'t attractive, he is not plot important.\n In D.N.Angel, if they\'re plot relevant and male, they will be Bish\u014dnen. (Bar Daisuke to some people but he could be considered cute in a Dojikko sort of way.)\n tsuritama is an extremely rare slice-of-life example where every male character have their own unique quirkiness.\n Donten ni Warau, wherein even the army mooks are mostly Bish\u014dnen. Basically, if you have as much as two words to contribute to whatever\'s happening, you will be pretty.\n Star Driver, where basically every single male of the important cast is very, very pretty. Hell, the main character is called Ginga Bish\u014dnen, for crying out loud! You know you\'re there when even the villain, who\'s actually so old that he\'s the hero\'s father, is confused for a hot highschool guy.\n With a 2:1 gender ratio and three of the four male characters being rather attractive humans and a Half-Human Hybrid (the fourth is a bear, though even he may be considered attractive for his species), there\'s no question the cast of Sands of Destruction is full of pretty boys. DVD Bonus Material acknowledges this by making Agan a model, Naja his up-and-coming rival model, and Kyrie an apparently-random choice for the world\'s third-best-looking man (behind Agan and Naja, of course).\n Death Note has quite a few Bishounen in its cast.\n Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! takes place at an all-boys school, with the main cast being made up entirely out of Ambiguously Gay Bishounen.\n Aruosumente: With only two named female characters, the cast is overwhelmingly male and everyone below the age of fifty and with a name is pretty.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n Most of the male Capricorn Pirates from One Piece: Parallel Works. One reviewer Lampshades this by saying, "All of the Capricorn males are either Bishounen or had the potential to become one - Yes, even Hatori and Thierry."\n The Secret Life Of The Backyard Kids. The girls could be counted on one hand.\n While the characters on South Park look identical aside from their hair and clothes, the vast majority of South Park fanfiction describes its main characters as attractive pretty boys.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n The Outsiders had Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, and Ralph Macchio. All were young, sometimes shirtless, and barely a girl in sight.\n Velvet Goldmine. Very young Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and still young Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale (clad in glitter, makeup and feathers, of course).\n The 2009 Star Trek movie has its cast invoking youth and sex appeal more than other Star Treks while keeping the cast mostly male.\n Most of the men in the movie franchise Twilight would make a woman/man pant, regardless of whether or not they even like the story.\n Interview with the Vampire had young Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater as the main cast. Oh, and Kirsten Dunst.\n The Lord of the Rings movies have a grand total of three female main characters, and almost all the rest are played by very handsome actors.\n Considering the books gave the females even less of a role...\n Subverted in The Hobbit where the prettiest of the cast is reduced by a half, mostly because nearly the rest are playing older dwarves.\n Gattaca, thanks to Designer Babies.\n It doesn\'t take much to see that the cast of The Avengers is eye candy, and there seem to be only two females in the movie that have any part whatsoever. Even the villain is too hot for words.\n Fight Club seems to do this on purpose. It gives the female audience highly attractive men like Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Jared Leto in varying states of undress, a ton of Ho Yay... and then has them violently beat the shit out of each other. If you\'re into that kinda thing you\'ll be in heaven.\n The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has a ludicrously attractive array of males\u25ca in the cast - the females are pretty too, but there\'s much fewer of them since the movie\'s target audience was teenage girls.\n Les Mis\xe9rables. Seriously, at least half the movie focuses on a whole band of ridiculously attractive young men in a revolutionary fervor and singing gorgeously. And the older guys are played by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n The perpetually angst-ridden, ridiculously good-looking, fanservicey-as-hell (almost entirely) male cast of Supernatural, especially since the show likes to kill off any supporting female character. Combined with the unavoidable Ho Yay, it almost seems as if it is being written solely to appeal to fangirls.\n Every new Kamen Rider series.\n Not just the new ones. A good chunk of the old ones were considered "Showa Hotties" when their series were on.\n At first, in Flashpoint, the only female character on the team was Action Girl Jules. Before Leah joined the team after Lewis Young\'s death. Even Lampshaded the episode when Leah joined and the woman\'s locker room\'s sign was changed from Jules to Women.\n Heroes has about a dozen main characters, all but two of whom are male. And they\'re so pretty...\n In Season 4 of Merlin, Prince Arthur assembles his Knights of the Round Table. Recruitment seems to be based on how very, very pretty they are.\u25ca Also, how drop-dead gorgeous our title character\u25ca is.\n The Warblers in Glee are, for the most part, very hot and very good at singing. And it only becomes more so after Kurt transfers to Dalton.\n All the other hot guys on the show - Finn, Sam, Puck and Mike for starters. Also Will, Sebastian and Joe.\n The Vampire Diaries: The Salvatores, Jeremy, Tyler, Alaric, Klaus and Matt - and that\'s just the main cast!\n Noah\'s Arc: The only man of even average attractiveness in the main cast might be Alex (even that point is debatable), with all the other guys having absolutely perfect physiques.\n Teen Wolf. Those poor, beautiful, beautiful lacrosse players. They can\'t even manage to keep their shirts on for more than ten minutes at a time.\n Friday Night Lights.\n Even the most feminist-leaning seasons of Power Rangers have an almost two-to-one ratio of male to female characters (standard procedure is four male rangers, two female; changes to the formula only lead to fewer females such as the five-to-one Ninja Storm.) This leads to an almost all-male cast of young, good-looking, athletic pretty boys year after year.\n Highlander has this in spades. Duncan, Methos, Richie...many of the baddie immortals aren\'t exactly ugly either. It\'s not an *all* male cast, due to Tessa in season 1 and the recurring Amanda and Dr. Lindsay later on, but it fits. The films have it as well, but the series is more noticeable.\n Skins seemingly uses a very simple recipe for casting: "hot" and "in their late teens" which naturally results in this trope on the male side. Especially present in the third generation, when Nick, Matty, Rich, Rider and Alex can all be counted as pretty boys.\n A number of Korean dramas fit this trope, but particularly Coffee Prince, in which a sexy 30-something rake overhauls a coffee shop by hiring only sexy young men. Of course, one of them is someone he only thinks is a young man.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note\n The main cast of consists of four boys and one girl. While the boys are not exactly bishonen, they are good-looking enough that western viewers of the anime adaptation often wondered the possibility a case of reverse harem (as the girl is The Protagonist). Being a series written for tweens, that is obviously unlikely.\n The spinoff Genie Team G Jiken Note, however, plays this trope the most straight; the male cast\u25ca there is the most bishonen allowed in a Children\'s Literature artwork.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n This trope defines the Japanese talent agency Johnny\'s and Associates.\n Two words: Boy Bands. It doesn\'t even matter if they can play instruments or have talent. If all the members are fairly good looking, they fall under this trope.\n All K-pop boy groups. Don\'t even try to deny it.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pro Wrestling\xa0\n An accusation Delirious threw at Ultimo Dragon\'s Toryumon promotion while he was working for it, one that many people agree with though most of them don\'t find it such a bad thing. This is less true of regional variants such as Dragon Gate USA and Toryumon Mexico, but only slightly.\n Most of the WWE roster, to the point that quite a few wrestlers have even made their pretty looks a part of their gimmick, or given themself a nickname to reflect that they\'re a part of this trope. Examples include "Prince Pretty" Tyler Breeze, "The Shaman of Sexy" John Morrison, and of course "Dashing" Cody Rhodes.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Radio\xa0\n Big Finish\'s \'\'The Confessions Of Dorian Gray\'\'\u25ca (yes that Dorian Gray) manages to pull this off despite it being a sound only medium (which is a great pity)\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n The entire Angelique series. Ditto Kin\'iro no Corda and Harukanaru Toki no Naka de. This is the point of the NeoRomance series.\n Many characters in Inazuma Eleven are this. Some of them even look prettier than the female cast. Of course this applies to the anime as well.\n Nearly every male character in Dynasty Warriors is, if not a downright Bish\u014dnen, rather good-looking, although all of the bishonen are from one of the Three Kingdoms (when they\'re not moonlighting due to game circumstances). Before DW7, Wu had the highest concentration of bishonen; now, Jin takes the crown, seemingly designed to be a Ghetto. Since Samurai Warriors is derived from Dynasty Warriors, it\'s only natural that the trope applies there as well.\n Sengoku Basara, the Capcom rival to Koei\'s Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors, is loaded with lots of male characters, who are things for female players to ogle at. Most of its characters satisfy some kind of fetish, but it\'s usually arguable that guys like Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura, Mori Motonari and Chosokabe Motochika come out on top of the popularity list.\n The Final Fantasy franchise have always catered to this trope on some level, though only by including one or two "token" bishonen rather than a whole harem. However, Kingdom Hearts relishes coming up with more and more bishonen to throw into the fray, the biggest example being Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II, in which the villains are a sprawling organization of super-hot men with one token female on the team.\n The all-star fighting game Dissidia: Final Fantasy includes the main hero and villain out of the first ten games in the franchise. This leads to 21 out of 24 male leads. The heroes only have one girl on their side (leaving out Shanttoto, who\'s a bonus character). By default, the game qualifies for this trope just for including Cecil and Kuja in the same cast. The female headcount goes down by one when you realize that Cloud of Darkness is actually genderless and only takes the form of a beautiful woman.\n Final Fantasy XV takes this trope and runs with it, featuring an all-male party that fans have compared to a boy band.\n While Harvest Moon games have the option of playing a female and thus providing a list of eligible bachelors, some of the more recent ones have started slipping in greater amounts of this into the bachelor selection to point where it\'s a Base Breaker amongst fans (as older games had handsome but more realistically "normal" rural men). Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility even includes a guy feminine you can woo him with flowers. Not surprising, as one of the chief complaints of female players was that the roster of wives were significantly better looking and interesting than the grooms. The spinoff Rune Factory and its sequels amps this up: even the main character, who is male, can be considered cuter than one or two of the bachelorettes.\n Rune Factory tends more toward the opposite end of the spectrum, though; more often than not, almost every job in town is done by a cute, single girl (and/or her sadly unmarriable mother). Particularly glaring in Rune Factory Oceans, the first game to feature a female player option at all; Sonia gets four choices for marriage (including Aden), while Aden gets ten. Rune Factory 4, which will be the first to feature a female option from the beginning, looks as though it will end up with a more even pretty boy/pretty girl ratio.\n Meine Liebe follows this trope with unabashed faithfulness, adding plenty of Ho Yay thrown in for good measure.\n The anime was worse, reducing the female character in the games to token appearances.\n Yo-Jin-Bo, being a Romance Game, is all about the bishounen. The only girl who appears onscreen besides yourself is Hatsuhime (who kinda is still you, in a way). A couple of maids may speak during the endings, but they never get to be in the picture.\n Pick an otome game. Any otome game. This trope is the point.\n Touken Ranbu is about bringing famous Japanese swords to life in order to fight an evil force...and all of these swords take on the forms of pretty boys and handsome men.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Animation\xa0\n Parodied in Senpai Club. The titular senpai (bar the one female) are all varying degrees of anime stereotypes such as the Long-Haired Pretty Boy and the keet. The problem is that they\'re drawn in a very simplistic and stylistic way compared to everyone else, who is animesque.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n Hanna Is Not a Boy\'s Name has many, many pretty men to suit everyone\'s taste, and a total of two significant female characters (one of whom at first seems like a Villain of the Week). Check out the cast lineup.\n The Dreamer has almost every taste, and only one major female character.\n Noblesse the online manhwa, has hot bishonen aplenty\u2014and they end up living in the same house. Yaoi fangirls, right\u25ca this way.\u25ca\n The Law of Purple frequently displays its prettyboys shirtless.\n Large enough portion of the cast of Roommates are Pretty Boys to qualify despite having several strong women characters who get panel time.\n Black Haze, to a ridiculous extent. Almost every male character, young or even older, is absolutely gorgeous.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n The four main men of Demo Reel. Donnie flirts with everyone and is played by an actor who self-admittedly lives for a sexual attention, Tacoma is in drag for the latter half of the series and is regularly told he looks hot, Karl\'s sexy German accent gets him a foursome at the con, and hunky Quinn is dressed in shirts that show off his muscles. The only female character, Rebecca, is also pretty, but very pointedly not sexualized to get across the message that women are treated like shit in Hollywood.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Judging by the many statements and fanworks of the fangirls, Transformers Prime follows this trope.\n Possibly unintentional on the part of its creators, Metalocalypse fits this trope. Dethklok and their manager are all attractive (even Murderface has his offbeat charm) males, the only female characters are extras or, in one case, a recurring villain, and the show is liberally peppered with Ho Yay.\n This was Lampshaded in a season 4 episode where the band goes on vacation to the Middle East and are mistaken for women by absolutely everyone. Even the few guys who believe they\'re men still find them attractive.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/BBG_3138.jpg', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre':

I do like \'em pretty! But look at this boy, he\'s even prettier!"\n\u2014 Ultros (regarding Noel Kreiss), Final Fantasy XIII-2\n\n\n\n\nA popular Asian character type, the bish\u014dnen, or "beautiful boy", is a male character that possesses androgynous or "feminine" physical traits. He is usually tall, slender with almost no fat and little to no muscle, and no body or facial hair. Large, expressive eyes are almost a given, though Tsurime Eyes are also common in more serious examples. In anime, many bish\u014dnen have female voice actors (most comedically, Naruto Uzumaki), although those that don\'t get startlingly deep, sexy voices instead. It is not uncommon for those at the more feminine end to be mistaken for women by other characters, or for savvier examples of the type to take advantage of such an assumption.\nBish\u014dnen can be found equally distributed between heroes and villains; bish\u014dnen villains often develop devoted followings among fans. Bish\u014dnen with white hair are almost always villains, no matter how they initially seem.\nIn the English fandom, the term bish\u014dnen simply connotes "a really, really attractive male", but in its original usage, it refers to a specific type of attractiveness that is found in adolescents. The cutoff for bish\u014dnen in the strict sense is around 20 years old. Beyond this age, the Japanese describe male attractiveness through terms like biseinen or bidanshi ("beautiful man") or ikemen (roughly "good-looking guy"). The affectionate English fandom shorthand "bishie" bypasses the lexical issues somewhat. Examples of both bish\u014dnen and biseinen should be placed on this page. Likely to have drawn on a moe aesthetic when they were younger.\nThe comparable Korean concept is kkot-minam ("flower pretty boy"). The most similar Western type is Pretty Boy.\nThe appearance and behavior of the archetypal bish\u014dnen is often used to explore sexuality and gender norms. Thus, Yaoi Guys have a tendency to be this.\nOriginally, bish\u014dnen characters were the province of shoujo and Boys Love Genres, but since the mid-90s, it has become the default style for teenage boys in pretty much any work looking for a cross-demographic audience. Since more modern anime and manga are overwhelming geared towards appealing to both men and women in this respect, a large majority of virtually all mainstream works will feature at least one bish\u014dnen character, if not more. Also the farther bish\u014dnen characters disseminate from their source genres, the less likely it becomes that there will be in-universe mention of their androgynous looks/attractiveness.\nOlder Than Print, since The Tale of Genji has it in spades. Often comes with the Bishie Sparkle. If all the guys are bish\u014dnen without many women to balance them out, you\'ve got yourself a Cast Full of Pretty Boys.\nRelated to Rule of Glamorous. The Long-Haired Pretty Boy is a standard bish\u014dnen design.\nContrast Gonk, The Grotesque, and Puni Plush. Also contrast Hunk which can nonetheless cross over with this trope, such as for Vega from Street Fighter. Pretty girls are known as Bishoujo ("beautiful girl"), but the esthetics of bishoujo are different, typically emphasizing cute, petite femininity rather than sleek androgyny. See Bifauxnen for ladies who conform a bit more closely to the bish\u014dnen aesthetic.\n\nExamples\nThis is an East Asian media only trope. For pretty boys in other cultures see Pretty Boynote\xa0The difference is primarily cultural, and it is not at all uncommon for Animesque media to use this trope much in the same way as the examples here, but for convenience\'s sake, let\'s just put the Eastern ones here and the Western ones there..\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \nAnime and Manga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many examples in anime and manga that they\'re being put in their own section.\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A - H\xa0\n Ai no Kusabi: Everyone but a few minor characters, especially Riki.\n Akira from Ai Ore Love is so bishonen he can pass as a girl, and Even the Guys Want Him. A majority of the men in the series are bishonen.\n In AKIRA, there\'s Kai, aka Kaisuke, who\'s short, slim, well-dressed, girlishly faced, and can knock a guy through a window. Being relatively sensitive and apparently crushing on Kaneda in the manga and Yamagata in the anime, he\'s often perceived as a young homosexual.\n Seiya Kanie and Takaya Kurisu from Amagi Brilliant Park\n Anatolia Story (a.k.a Red River): there are about four male characters in the entire series that don\'t fit this trope. The artwork is Viewer Gender Confusion incarnate.\n A majority of the male cast from Angel Beats!.\n Just about every male character in the OVA for Angels Feather.\n Mei from Arashi No Yoru Ni manages to be this even though he\'s a non-anthro goat.\n Even if Arata Kangatari is aimed at boys, it wouldn\'t be a Watase manga without a few of these. In particular, Yorunami\'s bishiness gets lampshaded by Hinohara.\n Ask Dr. Rin!: Tokiwa, Eddy, and Banri.\n Many characters in Axis Powers Hetalia are actually mislabeled as this (and the fanart doesn\'t help); the art style is very Puni Plush, thus the majority of the male designs are simply moe. The ones that aren\'t moe usually fall more into the hunk category (and even then, there\'s overlap) and there\'s even a few bara-type characters, such as Turkey. The purest bishounen in the series would be Austria.\n Huey Laforet from Baccano! takes this to the point of confusing people in-universe (you know you look girly when one of the prettiest woman in the series is your nigh-identical adult daughter, and you know you look really girly when you are not mistaken for beautiful women, but beautiful women are mistaken for you). Firo, while never being mistaken for a woman like Huey has, has been mocked by a detective in the Light Novels for skewing quite close to the Uke aesthetic. Claire Stanfield, aka. Rail Tracer, also fits. Jacuzzi also fits, although he has that giant tattoo on his face.\n Graham Specter also definitely qualifies\u25ca, even if he is a total psychopath.\n Christopher Shouldered is noted in the books to be quite pretty \u2014 if you can get past the utterly terrifying eyes and teeth.\n Barajou no Kiss: most of the male characters.\n Every main male character in Beauty Pop.\n Griffith from Berserk is explicitly labeled as "too beautiful to be a man" in about a dozen separate chapters by different characters! He even wears lipstick after transforming into Femto.\n Every male character in Betrayal Knows My Name.\n Every male character in Black Bird, but especially Kyo, whom Misao mistakes for a pretty girl upon seeing him as an adult.\n A good amount of the male characters from Black Butler. Except for Baron Kelvin, who realizes this and is obsessed with "becoming beautiful", Georg von Siemens, Jumbo, Lord Arthur Randall, Azzurro Vanel, Fred Aberline, Damian, and Doctor.\n Creed\u25ca from Black Cat. There is also Train\u25ca, Lin Shaolee\u25ca, and Jenos\u25ca.\n Black Lagoon:\n Rotton the Wizard, to an extent. He basically exists just to look cool and talk fancy. Revy even asks him if he\'s a man whore.\n Though still a kid, Garcia\'s beginning to grow into a handsome young man.\n Hansel also shows signs of this. Unfortunately, he didn\'t live long enough to grow into an adult.\n And in an Omake, we see that Sgt. Boris used to look like this; he joined the Army to toughen up. All the "de-aged" girl characters wail that he should stay this way.\n Zen from the manga Blank Slate. He\'s so bishounen, even his blind love interest can tell he\'s handsome just from touching his face.\n Bleach:\n Ayasegawa Yumichika is defined by his connection with beauty. Not only in looks but in lifestyle, too. He even accepted a lower rank in his squad than he had to because he thought that, in kanji, the number 5 was more "beautiful" than 4.\n Byakuya Kuchiki is very bishonen and is often voted "Seireitei\'s Sexiest Male Shinigami" by the Shinigami Women\'s Institute.\n Ukitake, a white-haired Long-Haired Pretty Boy, is almost as bishounen as Byakuya.\n Ishida Uryuu has a very slender, delicate build and an exceptionally fair complexion for a male character. He takes after his father Ryuuken, who is a Silver Fox, and who was his school\'s heartthrob when he was Uryuu\'s age.\n Ichigo is also a bishounen, especially when his hair starts growing.\n Aizen is bishounen.\n In chapter 409, Tensa Zangetsu reveals himself for the first time and he\'s as bishounen as it gets. Yes, even Zangetsu didn\'t escape.\n Also, Szayel Aporro Granz.\n Shukuro Tsukishima.\n Gin. Yes, that Gin. Kubo\'s goal may have been to make him creepy, but a lot of girls viewed him as bishounen instead.\n Muramasa, the Big Bad of the Zanpakuto Strange Tales Arc.\n Ouko Yushima from the Invading Army Arc.\n The end of chapter 670 gives us our young Toshiro Hitsugaya all grown up so he can use the full potential of his Bankai.\n Solomon Goldsmith from Blood+. Can\'t forget tall, dark, and handsome Haji.\n Ema\'s thirteen stepbrothers in Brothers Conflict. Wataru might not count yet, considering the fact that\'s he\'s only 10, but will likely grow into this trope when older.\n Many of the male characters in Chibisan Date.\n Pretty much the entire premise of Boku no Pico.\n Chrono Crusade has a few examples.\n Joshua Christopher is the most obvious example from the series\u2014he\'s quite thin (even implied to look underweight at one point), has pale blond hair and blue eyes, and looks quite a bit like his sister.\n Aion is a bit more borderline\u2014he\'s actually quite muscular when he takes off his Badass Long Coat, but his long, white hair does a lot to give him an edge of androgynous beauty. He\'s maybe a bit more of a biseinen.\n Chrono is a tricky one. In his true form, he\'s a bit rough around the edges and his outfit goes out of the way to highlight his muscular chest, but in his Sleep-Mode Size, he\'s got longer hair and looks much younger (and thus cuter). However, he still has moments of looking quite pretty in his true form, and a flashback in the manga shows him with long hair, which definitely qualifies him.\n Even Claymore manages to have one of these in the cast: Isley of the North.\n All the students in Cluster Edge.\n Corsair: all the men are very pretty, except Barbossa.\n Benten from Cyber City Oedo 808. Yes, he does wear lipstick and paint his nails. No, he isn\'t a Crossdresser.\n In Detective Conan, Hondou Eisuke gets an "You would have been a cute girl in a manga" from Sonoko, even if that might be mostly because of his behaviour rather than his very feminine appearance.\n Every character who isn\'t a Mentor Mascot in Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!. Goura, brother to The Hero, is an inversion. There\'s also a Bishonen monster but this is a zigzag because his original form looks like Takeo and his monster form looks like a 60s version of a bishonen.\n Death Note:\n Light Yagami.\n Mello, Near, Mikami, Matsuda, Gevanni, Matt, and Namikawa.\n What with the odd mannerisms and dark bags under his eyes, L was intended to be an inversion or aversion of this trope. The legions of fangirls he has don\'t see it that way, though...\n The contrast between Light and L (and their respective fangirls) are even lampshaded a bit in Episode 9, when they\x92re giving a university entrance speech together:\n Girl 1: I sure like the guy on the right [L].\n Girl 2: What\x96?! You\x92re weird. Most people would choose the one on the left [Light].\n Owing to his status as L\'s evil lookalike, Beyond Birthday is regarded as this as well by fangirls. Interesting example in that it\'s not clear exactly what he looked like, or how much he did/did not resemble L, as BB wore makeup to look more like him.\n Ryuk was this in his original design\u25ca, before the creators decided that him looking more interesting than Light could cause fans to ignore Light\'s character.\n Rem in the live-action films. Despite being a female Shinigami in the manga and anime, she was made a male in-voice-only for the live-action movies. The rest of her feminine looking design\u25ca is kept exactly the same.\n Most of the guys in Descendants of Darkness.\n Shoei and Hinata from Desire Climax are both very pretty.\n Allen from D.Gray-Man definitely fits here, seeing as he\'s prettier than a lot of the girls in the series. Lavi, Tyki, and Kanda fit as well.\n Both Ishida Yamato and Ichijouji Ken of Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 fall into this category. Their actual looks are never commented upon, but one figures that this is at least partially why they are fangirl bait, both in and out of the show. Also lampshaded in an Audio Drama.\n Well, there was that page in the translation of the 02 manga where Daemon calls Ken "the pretty one" (if you\'re thinking that\'s too creepy for words, then you\'re probably still sane).\n In one episode of zero two, Gabumon lampshades this by saying "Yamato isn\'t the only heartthrob here", while Ken was hit on by a very young girl.\n Yamato, notably, had a...considerably older woman try to pick him up when he was eleven.\n To a lesser extent, Takeru, Yamato\'s little brother, seems to gain some level of bish\u014dnen in him when he turned eleven himself. An episode of Digimon Adventure 02 showed a fair number of girls\u2014Hikari among them\u2014practically swooning over him when he was showing off his basketball skills.\n In Digimon Adventure tri., pretty much all of the boys have this aesthetic to them. Yamato/Matt and Takeru/TK (the latter is even shown to have invited a couple of female admirers to the former\'s concert) seem to be the ones who were drawn this way on purpose, but Taichi/Tai, Koushiro/Izzy and even Joe have also gotten quite pretty as well. Mimi lampshades this in regards to Tai and Matt, mentioning that they\'ve grown to be quite attractive (with Sora blushing in response). Heck, even Tai\'s teacher is pretty!\n Dragon Ball Z:\n Future Trunks, Zarbon, Android 17, and arguably Jeice.\n Zarbon in particular is The Fighting Narcissist; his true form is not pretty at all, and he takes a handicap in battle to maintain his good looks.\n Yamcha, especially when he first arrives to fight the Saiyans.\n In the Ocean dub, Burter describes Goku to Jeice this way. "If it weren\'t for you being short and orange, I\'d say he was the better-looking guy."\n Most of the male characters in D.N.Angel.\n Hakuoh of Duel Masters has to be one of the bishiest, with his slender build and long, flowing, silvery-blue hair.\n Durarara!!:\n Kasuka, Shizuo, Izaya, and Shinra. And then Mikado, Kida, Aoba, Seiji, Tanaka Tom, Walker, Shijima, Chikage and...Nasujima-sensei. Unfortunately.\n Minor character Ryo Takigutchi. Seriously, just\u25ca look at him\u25ca!\n Akira Takizawa from Eden of the East is a prime example of this trope, yet much more realistic than some others.\n Elfen Lied: Nousou. Kurama is a borderline example, but is an older man and later grows a Beard of Sorrow.\n Baskerville and Alternate in Et Cetera are quite pretty, helped by Basky\'s long blond hair and Alternate\'s slim figure and monocle.\n Il Palazzo of Excel Saga is very pretty and has long, silver hair.\n Although Eyeshield 21 has a good amount of beefcakes, there\'s also Kisaragi, Kakei, Mizumachi, Akaba, Sakuraba, Harao, and maybe even Taka.\n Zeref from Fairy Tail is revealed to be this after they spend 200 chapters building him up as some great ancient evil. Expecting Someone Taller, or at least older looking, is in full swing here.\n Bedivere from Fate/stay night. He looks and sounds so much like a woman in fact that in a series where King Arthur was revealed to actually be a woman in disguise, many fans at first believed him to simply have undergone the same fate. But, no. He\'s just pretty.\n Lancer of Fate/Zero (aka Diarmuid Ua Duibhne) takes prettiness up to the realm of being a superpower - literally. Unfortunately, supernatural levels of beauty does not mix well with jealous lords and their smitten fiances.\n Mikagami Tokiya from Flame of Recca. He doesn\'t like being mistaken for a girl, though.\n All the male characters introduced so far in Kyoto Animation\'s anime Free!. They are more muscular (which is due to their athletic activities) than the standard.\n Fruits Basket:\n Yuki, and all of the male Sohmas.\n Particularly Momiji, Ritsu, and Ayame. The first wears the girls\' school uniform (albeit not with a skirt) because "it looks cuter on him", while the second presents himself as a woman because of an inferiority complex the size of Antarctica. Ayame, on the other hand, is...just special. Akito also qualifies in the anime, although manga Akito is a different story altogether.\n The lead, Tohru Honda, remarks that the Sohmas are a family of "princes". And towards the end of the manga\'s run, even Momiji graduates to pure Bish\u014dnen status with a growth spurt and switch to the boy\'s uniforms.\n The Bish\u014dnen archetype in sh&#333;jo is parodied quite a few times on cover flaps of Fullmetal Alchemist (more often than not with Roy as the target) and through Mei Chan\'s daydreams about Ed, and then Al, as knights in shiny armours.\n Major Alex Armstrong also appears as a sort of parody, both meeting every bishonen archetype yet defying it too. Not only does he meet the quota of sparkling, hairlessness, beauty, deep voice, and vanity, he\'s also a muscular, oversized bodybuilder, who constantly flexes and lacks an indoor voice.\n At the end of the manga and second anime, Alphonse is revealed to be a gorgeous bishonen.\n He\'s arguably even more of one in the movie of the first anime, since he  shares his brother\'s long hair.\n Ed\'s always been Bish\u014dnen, and even has long hair.\n One of Father\'s transformations turns him into one of these.\n In the first anime, Roy actually sparkles during his "Flame vs. Fullmetal" duel with Ed - a trait usually reserved for Armstrong.\n Full Metal Panic! brings us Kurz, who was even a former model. Then, we\'ve got Leonardo. And, of course, Sousuke, in an Unkempt Beauty sort of way.\n Just about every male character from Fushigi Yuugi. Most of their brothers from other Yuu Watase manga are bishies as well. It\'s Yuu Watase, what do you expect?\n Future Diary: Yuki and Akise.\n Game X Rush: Memori and Yuuki.\n Gankutsuou: Franz, Albert, and especially Andrea.\n GaoGaiGar. Paragon of Hot-Blooded manliness he may be, but Gai Shishio is still too pretty to be male\u25ca.\n Kousaka from Genshiken. The most feminine-looking male club member, he is the only one with a girlfriend in the beginning, let alone a sex life.\n Most of the male characters in Get Backers, but Kazuki takes it to almost painful levels.\n Ghost Hound: the entire male cast for the most part, especially Tarou, who is downright Moe.\n Ghost Hunt: almost all of the male characters. Lin, Naru, Bou-san, even John are bish\u014dnens, pretty boys, handsome, etc, etc...you watch a video of Ghost Hunt on YouTube, scroll through the comments, and you will find a lot of fangirling female users.\n Sougo Okita, Kotarou Katsura, and Kamui of Gintama.\n Every guy from Gravitation, especially Yuki and Shuichi.\n Gundam has its fair share of bishie boys.\n Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, in particular, was full of them. And among the Gundam Wing bishie brigade, Quatre Winner deserves special mention. A slim, platinum-blond Berber. Needless to say, you can find a fairly large amount of fanart of him.\n Protagonist Heero Yuy also deserves a mention, since Word of God admitted that his appearance was inspired by a Japanese actress, Yuki Uchida.\n Mobile Fighter G Gundam has George DeSand from Neo France, operator of Gundam Rose.\n Kamille Bidan, the main protagonist of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.\n Almost all of the male cast in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny.\n Gundam 00, oh ho ho. Apparently, every male under the age of 35 will be absolutely gorgeous in the 24th century, in addition to shrinking their shirts in the dryer to show off their buff figures. Then again, this was pretty well predicted the second they announced that Yun Koga would be designing 00\'s cast.\n We also need to mention Turn A Gundam\'s Loran, who was quite possibly one editorial mandate away from being a full-blown woman.\n Mobile Suit Gundam: Char\'s Counterattack. While he\'s too old to count as a bish\u014dnen, Char Aznable looks far more prettyboy-ish\u25ca than he did in earlier series, this makes him Biseinen.\n Even in the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Char stands out as a pretty boy, notable because the art style of the time rendered almost every other character Gonk. The only character to rival his bishounen-ness is Garma.\n Hakuouki is full of effeminate pretty-boys. The entire series is basically a reverse harem, and is guaranteed to make anyone\'s inner Fangirl Squee! in joy.\n Numerous male characters in \xbd Prince.\n Hana No Kishi: Ibara, Saiki, Houjou, and Midori.\n Itsuki Koizumi in Haruhi Suzumiya. That is, in a Brigade of crazy people, with a cynical Deadpan Snarker who constantly tells him that no one cares about him. He probably just appears to be one, but he sure seems to make most women blush. As Kyon puts it, \'A face I wouldn\'t introduce to my girlfriend\'.\n Hellsing: appearance-wise, Luke is a sophisticated prettyboy. Also, Schrodinger and young Walter. Alucard is the Biseinen version of this trope.\n Tamamo from Hell Teacher Nube gets away with lots of things that Nube is beaten up for just because he\'s a Bish\u014dnen\n Joey from Heroman... well, let\'s just say that just about everyone mistook him for a girl at first. Psy, too.\n Highschool DXD Gives us Yuuto Kiba\u25ca\n Taken even further by Gasper\u25ca Vladi\u25ca Yes... That is a boy. Warning, the first image linked may be considered NSFW\n Hunter \xd7 Hunter: Hisoka, despite also being a Monster Clown. Less unusually, Kurapika and Shaiapouf.\n Hyouka gives us Houtarou, Satoshi, Masashi, Jirou, and Muneyoshi.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I - P\xa0\n Most of the male cast of Ikoku Irokoi Romantan.\n Inukami!: Keita and Hake, as well as most other male characters who isn\'t macho or Gonk.\n A number of male characters from InuYasha, including Sesshoumaru, Naraku, etc.\n Inux Boku SS has a Cast Full of Pretty Boys - Miketsukami Soushi being in the spotlight.\n Katori, Dom, and the nameless terrorist from the second episode (who is mentioned because his prettiness is a plot point) from Irresponsible Captain Tylor.\n JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure features Noriaki Kakyoin, who is only this compared to the rest of the main cast due to being the shortest and the least buff. Nevertheless, he is a VERY popular example on Pixiv and a target of Wimpification. Part 5 plays this more straight with its Cast Full of Pretty Boys, especially Narancia.\n There is a lot of focus on people\'s looks in Jyu-Oh-Sei, despite the action being set mostly on a jungle planet with vicious plants and a murderous climate that\'s used as a prison for criminals. All of the male characters are\u25ca exceptionally\u25ca pretty\u25ca.\n Kaguya Hime: many, if not most of the male cast; in particular, Yui and movie star Brett Miller. Nobuo is a very notable aversion.\n Kamisama Kiss has quite a few. To start off you have Kurama along with Tomoe and Mizuki\n K\xe4mpfer: Natsuru Senou in his male form.\n Kare Kano: Hideaki Asaba and Soichiro Arima.\n Ren from Karin\n Leon Oswald and Yuri Killian in Kaleido Star.\n Karakuridouji Ultimo: most of the doji. Also, Murayama and Rune.\n Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru has the pretty boy protagonist, Minoru.\n Karneval: Most of the guys introduced, including 99% of the main male cast.\n Every single male main character in post-Art Evolution Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, plus 99% of the villains and side cast. This is the most common trope on the character page.\n Akiyoshi of Kawaii Akuma (and its sequels) is often told that he is "cute" or "pretty", and this caused him to develop an inferiority complex. Naruse is also incredibly Bish\u014dnen, to the point of being a Dude Looks Like a Lady.\n A good portion of the cast of Kaze to Ki no Uta, but Gilbert and Rosemarine deserve special mention.\n Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple has Christopher Eclair, a French assassin. It\'s also revealed that Kensei Ma used to be one.\n On the off chance that the audience didn\'t realize Aikuro Mikisugi was the designated Bish\u014dnen of Kill la Kill, Studio Trigger literally made the word beauty part of his name (\u7f8e\u6728\u6749).\n Kimi ni Todoke: Kazehaya, and the female side of the school is very aware of this. Ryu and Kento also count.\n Kimi to Boku: All the main boys in the cast\u25caas well as Hot Teacher Koichi Azuma & his best friend, Akira.\n Reiji from Kodomo no Jikan, especially in the anime. Of course, he\'s a seriously fucked-up bishonen.\n Akito and Naozumi from Kodomo no Omocha.\n Kisaragi Shun in Koko Wa Greenwood (aka This is Greenwood).\n K-On!: There are actually some\u25ca fairly\u25ca good\u25ca looking\u25ca male background characters\u25ca, considering the cute art style.\n Kyo Kara Maoh!\n Wolfram is very pretty (he looks almost exactly like his mother), a definite bish\u014dnen. In fact, Yuuri\'s immediate reaction upon seeing him for the first time is simply to stare in awe and call him exactly that.\n Also, Saralegui.\n Then there\'s every guy in Yuuri\'s "harem", plus Yuuri himself.\n The Legend of Koizumi:\n Pietro, the white knight serving under the pope. He comes complete with accompanying Bishie Sparkles when he first appears.\n Also.. Hitler. He is so Bishounen that his Bishie Sparkles have the ability to hypnotize people into worshipping him\u25ca He can also (in a pinch) go Super Aryan\u25ca\n Litchi Hikari Club has a Cast Full of Pretty Boys - with a strong lack of fanservice.\n A good amount of the male characters in Loveless. Ritsuka is even stated to be very pretty, like a girl.\n Otani, Kohori, Suzuki, Haruka, and, without a doubt, Maitake and Seiko from Lovely Complex.\n  Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha may be directed toward a Seinen demographic, with an Improbably Female Cast, but even it has its share of bishies, such as Yuuno Scrya and Verossa Acous. Yuuno, in particular, was mistaken for a girl by many viewers when he first appeared.\n In Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force, we can add former Cheerful Child Erio to that list. Seriously.\n Aburatsubo from Magic User\'s Club. He\'s tall, has long red hair, and is gorgeous...with the requisite legion of fan-girls expected for any bishonen. The only problem for said fangirls is that he\'s gay and in love with the main character, Takeo.\n Mahou Sensei Negima! gives Negi some magic age-up pills, turning him into one of these. He\'s also a dead ringer for his father, who was also a bishonen. Albireo Imma probably counts too. Teenage Kotaro definitely counts as well.\n Then there\'s teenage Fate...\n And Dynamis Yes, really.\n Maid-Sama!:\n Usui, when he makes the effort, and his half brother, Gerard Walker, who looks like an older and more polished version of him. One could also make a case for Tora Igarashi and Kuuga.\n Soichiro Kanou, too, if he had any confidence in himself, could likely pull this off. Also: a number of fangirls consider The Idiot Trio to be this, on the rare occasions when they\'re drawn normally.\n Mamotte Shugogetten: Izumo and Tasuke. Arguably Takashi as well.\n Kei, Michael (anime-only characters), Yuu, Satoshi, and arguably Ginta in Marmalade Boy.\n Mawaru-Penguindrum: Most of the guys. Main character Shouma is even one of these despite being teased by others that he\'s plain looking.\n Adolf Hitler is drawn this way in the manga version of Mein Kampf. It\'s hard to tell which is the most absurd; Hitler being portrayed as a Bish\u014dnen, or that there exists a Mein Kampf manga.\n Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch provides plenty of bishounen fanservice. The fact that practically every day is a Beach Episode helps.\n Metal Fight Beyblade: Being tanned doesn\'t stop Tsubasa Otori from being a Bishounen.\n Takaya Ohgi and Nobutsuna Naoe in Mirage of Blaze.\n Quite a few of Miyazaki\'s male characters, such as Haku in Spirited Away and Howl in Howl\'s Moving Castle.\n Most of the guys from Monochrome Factor, especially Shirogane, Akira, and Kou.\n Kusuriuri/the Medicine Seller from Mononoke. Even his manner of dress combines gender conventions, and characters in the series make note of how attractive he is.\n Johan from Monster. It\'s especially noticeable when you realize that the anime is one of the few that steers entirely out of the way of Generic Cuteness.\n It\'s even more noticeable when Johan dresses up like his sister and nobody can tell the difference, to the extent of making a male, heterosexual policeman infatuated with him. If all it takes for you to go from a good-looking man to a beautiful woman is a wig and a dress, odds are good that you fit this trope very well.\n He is even explicitly stated to be beautiful by a few people. Even Tenma comments on how he has beautiful eyes.\n Nearly every male character in Monthly Girls\' Nozaki-kun to date, aside from Ken and Nozaki himself. Nozaki is a bit overly muscled by normal standards, to his despair (he can\'t use himself to model for his manga because he\'s not the right body type). For Ken, he\'s fat only when Maeno is in his life; at times he\'s away from Maeno he can fall into this trope as he becomes a lot skinnier.\n Kouichi Hayama, from Moonlight Lady, falls into this description perfectly. Lampshaded with Io Azuma, his wife-to-be\'s cousin; Suzuna was hoping that Io would grow to be this (partially because of an Arranged Marriage to him). Ultimately averted, as Io grew to be a limp-wristed, wide-eyed, Ambiguously Gay "pretty boy".\n Lint, Ricalna and even Zelik when we was younger from Mother Keeper all fit this.\n Michio in MW.\n Nabari no Ou: most of the guys under 30.\n Depending on who you ask, a good number of the male cast in Naruto could qualify as Bishonen. Notable examples include Haku (to Dude Looks Like a Lady levels), Benten (Filler Villain to Dude Looks Like a Lady levels), Sasuke, Itachi, Kakashi, Deidara, Sasori, Neji, Suigetsu, Kimimaro, Orochimaru (when he is not doing something gross), Kabuto, Sai, Gaara, Shikamaru, Kiba, Utakata, and the titular character himself. Naruto definitely counts, considering that he has his mom\'s AND his his dad\'s looks, though this trope is mostly appropriate only after the time skip. Also, the Fourth Hokage, aka Naruto\'s dad. Naruto and his peers\' kids are quite good looking too.\n Neon Genesis Evangelion:\n The character designer of wrote that he designed Shinji to be a delicate/vulnerable-looking bishonen.\n Kaworu is a bishonen of legendary proportions.\n Natsume, Tanuma, Natori, Nishimura - in fact, most of the male cast of Natsume\'s Book of Friends qualify as Bishonen.\n Nezumi and Shion from No6, especially Nezumi, who even dresses up as a girl in episode 5 and is rather convincing, too.\n Noblesse: Rai, Franken, Shinwoo, M-21, and Takeo.\n General Rivan of Nora, and probably Kazuma to certain readers.\n Nurarihyon No Mago has lots of Bishonen. Night Rikuo, Young Nurarihyon, Rihan, Kurotabou, Kuromaru, Tosakamaru, Keikain Mamiru, Shoukera, Yanagida, Kubinashi, and revived Seimei.\n Okane Ga Nai: Yukiya Ayase.\n One Piece:\n Sanji recently has been beating people pretty. His first victim, a hideous Wanze, was rapidly kicked across the face until he became (to his horror) this trope. Later, Sanji, fighting his bounty poster look-alike, does this again, much to his foe\'s joy.\n Played for Laughs in Boa Hancock\'s romantic fantasies about the normal looking main character Luffy - she sees him as typical Bishonen with a full Bishie Sparkle and brown eyes, as well as speaking with a more mature voice than he actually speaks with.\n The series now has its first definitive Bishonen. His name is Cavendish. Not only does he have the Bishie Sparkle, he also has large, glinting eyes, a trait commonly used only for female characters. His glinting eyes pretty much drive the point home, because the eyes of male characters in this series rarely glint, if at all.\n Otomen: the main male characters, especially Asuka, Juta, and Tonomine, whose looks are often commented on. Even Kurokawa can count, if his eyes showed up a lot more.\n Many characters of M\xc4R, on both sides of the good/evil divide. Alvis and Nanashi are this, combined with the headband of eyecovering. Every once-in-a-while, they even comment on it in-universe.\n Basically, all male characters from Ouran High School Host Club, and one of the females. Tamaki (see picture) slightly subverts the usual cool-headed bishie stereotype by being a blithering (but lovable) idiot, and manages to be the male lead and comic relief both at once.\n Harry from Outlaw Star. He even ties his hair with a big, pretty bow. Fred Luo, too.\n The Cast Full of Pretty Boys that is Pandora Hearts. Especially Jack, Vincent, Gilbert, and Break.\n Most other young-ish male characters also count, like Oz, Elliot and Leo. And the latter even more so after an Important Haircut.\n A notable example is Liam; the fact that no male or female pronouns were ever used to refer to him for some time didn\'t help. They fixed this in the anime, however, giving him less feminine features and a decidedly male voice.\n Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Brief is one of these, once his bangs are slicked back.\n George from Paradise Kiss, among many others.\n Peacemaker Kurogane: 99% of the characters are Bish\u014dnen.\n Toji, Kairi, Jigoro, and Ryo from Peach Girl.\n Jeeves and Bertie Wooster get this treatment in the manga series Please, Jeeves; Bertie becomes a Princely Young Man with golden hair while Jeeves is Tall, Dark and Handsome.\n +Anima: Husky. He\'s repeatedly mistaken for a girl.\n Pok\xe9mon\n Cilan, who was being subject to Ouran comparisons before Hilarious Inhindsight kicked in.\n Like in the games, N also fits on this trope.\n Cilan and Chili, Cilan\'s brothers, as well as Cheren also appear, though their roles are much minor.\n Though debatable, James from Team Rocket seems to be a comedic parody of Bishonen as well.\n The four older knights in Pr\xe9tear are examples of this trope, particularly Kei. Goh is borderline, but he makes up for it by baring his midriff in his knight outfit.\n A majority of the male cast of The Prince of Tennis, but especially Seiichi Yukimura, Rikkaidai\'s Knight Templar Magnificent Bastard once ill captain.\n All of the main characters in Princess Princess. Yuujirou, Mikoto, and Tooru being bishies is basically the whole point of the anime. They\'re princesses because they\'re bishies.\n Mytho in Princess Tutu has eyelashes thicker than his girlfriend\'s. Femio is also an over-the-top parody of this type. Ironic in that Vic Mignogna plays an only slightly toned-down version of Femio in Ouran High. Even better there because, no matter how cheesy he is, the girls there actually fall for it.\n The titular Yakumo from Psychic Detective Yakumo fits this trope to a T. Haruka even thinks he\'s a "beautiful person" when she first meets him. Also, a good amount of male college students who pop up.\n Psyren: Oboro, Haruhiko, Junas, Miroku, Shiner, Kabuto, and Shao as an adult.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Q - Z\xa0\n RahXephon:\n Ayato Kamina from is pretty enough that he\'d probably not look out of place in a dress.\n There\'s also Dr. Itsuki (who bears a suspicious resemblance to the above-mentioned Rossiu) and Souichi Yagumo (who bears a suspicious resemblance to his own girlfriend, Kim).\n Loki, Caesar, Cain, and Adel of Reimei No Arcana.\n Miki Kaoru from Revolutionary Girl Utena is mentioned to be one by Utena in the preview of the episode of his first appeareance. Also, practically every guy in the cast.\n Rosario + Vampire has Ginei, Hokuto, Kiria, Fong-Fong, and, after Art Evolution, Tsukune.\n Many of the characters from Rurouni Kenshin, especially the titular character, Mr. Pretty Boy Swordsman himself. Depending on the quality of the animation in an episode of the anime, particularly in the later episodes of the series, and you know, just about all the time in the manga, Kenshin is very pretty despite the fact that he\'s a terrifyingly powerful swordsman who even the manliest of men are afraid of. It doesn\'t help that, towards the end of the manga and in most of the official artwork, his hair always looks extremely long and flows like a bunch of ribbons. Just look at these pictures: [1], [2], [3], [4]. I rest my case. And even more so in the Trust & Betrayal and Reflections OVAS. [5] And then, you know, there\'s Soujiro, Aoshi, Sanosuke, and, heck, even Hiko qualifies, although he\'s pretty manly. Observe: [6].\n The Shitennou in the first season of Sailor Moon, Mamoru Chiba, Ali of the Doom Tree arc, Prince Diamond and Sapphire in Sailor Moon R, the Amazon Trio in Super S, and the Sailor Starlights...sort of. In the manga, even one of the cats qualifies for this with his long haired, midriff exposing human form. The cat in question (Artemis) is even named for a goddess.\n Saint Seiya. From Andromeda Shun\u25ca to Virgo Shaka\u25ca to Pisces Aphrodite\u25ca (yes, that\'s a guy), the place is a bishounen gold mine. See Viewer Gender Confusion for more details.\n And in Saint Seiya Omega, Dragon Shiryu\'s son Ryuhou is often compared to Shun, and for good reason\u25ca.\n Many characters from Samurai Deeper Kyo, including but not limited to Hotaru, Shinrei, Hishigi (technically a Biseinen, as he\'s physically about 30), and Akira.\n Masayoshi of Samurai Flamenco. Fittingly, he works as a model/Teen Idol because he has no other skills besides his good looks.\n Kyuzo in Samurai 7 is tall, slender, and androgynously beautiful; his voice, however, is very male. Shichiroji, too, and Katsushiro is close. Then there is when Gorobei, Heihachi, and Rikichi have to make it to Kanna village... in disguise.\n Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei: Nozomu Itoshiki and his brother Mikoto. Also, four of his only known male students: Jun Kudou, Kuniya Kino, Aoyama, and Haga.\n Almost every male character in Saiyuki. The four main characters are these, of course, but also Kougaiji, Dokugakuji, Hazel, Koumyu, and Ni Jian-Yi/Ukoku.\n Though the artist\'s style is such all the male characters in The Secret Agreement look pretty good, in-story, Iori is singled out as being an incredible beauty for a man.\n Seitokai no Ichizon gives us Ken Sugisaki and especially Nakameguro.\n Numerous guys qualify in Seraph of the End but Yuuji, Ferid, Crowley, Lacus Welt, Yuu, and especially Mika are particularly notable.\n Most of the males in Shugo Chara! are known for their Bishieness.\n Nagihiko Fujisaki takes the Bishie Ribbon in the world of Shugo Chara. When Hinamori first meets Nagihiko, he is actually posing as his female alter ego, Nadeshiko. Why is this boy posing as a girl? The Fujisaki family tradition is for the males to pose as females to learn the ways of Japanese Dancing.\n During the series, Nadeshiko tells Amu that \'she\' and Nagihiko are twins (the rest of the Guardians know about Nagi & Nade, but Amu Hinamori doesn\'t). It\'s not until late in the series that Nagi reveals the truth to Amu.\n Nagihiko: [7]. Nadeshiko: [8].\n Nagihiko even has a female Shugo Chara named Temari, which he can Character Transform into Yamato Maihime: [9].\n The entire male cast of Simoun. The younger men \u2014 who were girls until age 17 \u2014 even still have breasts that haven\'t been reabsorbed yet (especially the hunky chief mechanic Wapourif), and all of them are voiced by female voice actors.\n Skip Beat!: Shoutarou "Shou" Fuwa and Ren Tsuruga.\n Death the Kid, Gopher, and Kishin Asura from Soul Eater.\n Special A: you\'d think a beauty contest was part of the Special A qualifying exam, looking at the male cast. The girls, too, unsurprisingly, since a beauty exam is almost mandatory to be part of most Shoujo casts.\n Eyes Rutherford in Spiral.\n Star Driver\'s Takuto Tsunashi. "Galactic Bishonen" isn\'t a nickname; it\'s his official title as the Chosen One\n Maximilian Jenius from Super Dimension Fortress Macross and Macross7. Also, Linn Kaifun and Conda Bromco from the first series. Justified and repeatedly lampshaded in Macross Frontier with Alto Saotome, who is frequently remarked on for his resemblance to a woman (much to his annoyance). He, and his father, were Kabuki actors who specialised in female performances. Particularly obvious lampshade hanging is his nickname of \'Hime\' or \'princess\' cause he is just so darn pretty.\n A good amount of the male characters in Sukisho, especially Sunao.\n Kantarou Ichinomiya from Tactics is a white/very light brown? haired bishie, who is annoying and greedy, but overall a good person. He is so young looking, nobody really knows his age. It is implied that he is much older than he appears. Many other guys in it also qualify.\n Mochizou Ooji from Tamako Market\n Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n While the series is generally remembered for its more MANLY characters, after the Time Skip, Rossiu and Simon are undeniably quite bishonen.\n Cytomander is arguably a Bishonen as well, depending on who you talk to.\n What about Viral\u25ca?\n Kamina is a more masculine version than the standard issue bishonen, but he is undeniably pretty.\n Most of the male characters in I\'m Gonna Be an Angel!, but especially Mikael.\n Ichise and Touyama in Texhnolyze.\n Barnaby from Tiger & Bunny (regardless of what he is wearing, be it his battle suit with helmet off or his daily attire with glasses on)\n Ivan Karelin, Nathan\'s opinion is final - his face is on par with Barnaby\'s.\n Tokyo Ghoul has characters like these who\'s looks are commented on in story: Tsukiyama, Kaneki, Ayato, Juzuuya, and Hide. In the sequel there\'s also Furuta (though he\'s a evil and terrifying bishie), Urie, Mutsuki, Hige, and initially Kanae  before it\'s revealed Kanae is actually a she named Karen.\n Many a Tokyo Mew Mew character, covering types from Stalker with a Crush to Jerk with a Heart of Gold to Mysterious Protector (who wins).\n Ren, Rito, and Zastin of To Love-Ru.\n Trigun: Vash, Legato, Midvalley, Wolfwood, Livio, and Knives.\n Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle gives us Fai D. Fluorite and Syaoran,  especially when he\'s aged up a bit, and has quite a few famous bishonen from other CLAMP series pop up as cameos, such as Subaru, Kamui, Yasha, Yukito, and even Watanuki, to name a few.\n Lets not forget the most extreme cases, Kakyou (who, as if it was possible, is even more of a Bishonen here than in X, and Ashura-Ou, who quite a few fans are still convinced is a a woman (though Ashura was technically genderless in RG Veda and actually has no specified gender in this work).\n In Tsukigasa, Azuma is none too happy about being treated like a girl because of his looks, particularly because he was raped due to his resemblance to his mother.\n Keiki in The Twelve Kingdoms is a Bishonen with white hair, who acts as Youko\'s Mysterious Protector.\n Urusei Yatsura. Rei Lum\'s (former fiance) is a tall, stoic, green-haired space bish\u014dnen who drives men to despair and women to squee. Mendou also qualifies, which is basically his most obvious difference from Ataru.\n D from Vampire Hunter D. Even the Guys Want Him.\n With the exception of the vampire hunter Toga Yagari, absolutely all the male cast of Vampire Knight are bish\u014dnen.\n Canute from Vinland Saga, so Bishonen they needed a girl to be a convincing double.\n Dilandau in Vision of Escaflowne (who is later revealed to have been a magically disguised and brainwashed girl). Let\'s just say that most of the male cast is bish\u014dnen, especially Allen and Van. Just look at the opening, for God\'s sakes!\n This is the entire point of The Wallflower.\n Wei\xdf Kreuz gets points for admitting it. Youji calls Omi "bishounen" to his face in one episode, but he ain\'t the only one.\n Both Toboe and Kiba from Wolf\'s Rain look like Bish\u014dnen most of the time, but are actually wolves in disguise. To go further, numerous viewers have mistaken both for girls.\n Yamada Taro Monogatari: Taro, which is a large reason why everyone thinks he\'s Prince Charming. Also, Suguira, who initially views Taro as a rival of beauty.\n The human forms of the Weasel Mascots in Yes! Pretty Cure 5 are this. Coco\u25ca and Nuts\u25ca take it to truly\u25ca extraordinary levels.\u25ca GoGo! also brings us cute little boy Syrup\u25ca.\n Several characters in Yu-Gi-Oh!, including at least Yami Yugi, Seto Kaiba, Malik Ishtar (and how!), Ryou Bakura, Yami Bakura, Pegasus, Ryuji Otogi, and a number of minor supporting characters.\n Yu-Gi-Oh! takes this trope to such ridiculous extents that, chances are, if you\'re a major villain, you\'re probably going to be very feminine in appearance! Not to mention, its successors both have this trope in spades as well.\n The Abridged Series is loaded with jokes about this.\nMarik: Do I look like an \'\'[EFF]\'ing fangirl to you?! Florence: You really don\'t want me to answer that.\n The Obelisk Blue Three Geniuses for starters, as each of them represent a type of popular dere, starting from the Deredere Fubuki , the Kuudere Ryo, and the Yandere Yusuke in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. Most if not all of the male characters can be called bishies, really.\n Plus most of the male cast from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\'s\n III\u25ca and V Arclight from Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL.\n A good third of the male cast on YuYu Hakusho.\n 07-Ghost: Teito, Castor, Frau, Labrador, Ayanami, Mikage...Maybe almost all of the male characters of the entire story.\n\nOther examples\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Asian Animation\xa0\n White Phoenix from Qin\'s Moon, doesn\'t help that he gets prettier each season due to Art Evolution. It was even lampshaded during a mini-documentary. Zhang Liang and younger Wei Zhuang qualify as well.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Genji in Cloud of Sparrows, who is described as \'too pretty for a man\' \u2014 as is the character\'s Older Than Print namesake, Hikaru Genji in the Tale of Genji.\n Lord Krishna, the Hindu deity, is depicted as a bishonen in his adulthood. He is painted as a beautiful 20-year-old with clear dark or blue skin, dressed in distinctive yellow silk, and with a peacock feather attached to his diadem. Despite his bishonen appearance, Krishna is The Ace - a superb intellectual, scholar, strategist, warrior, charioteer and Chick Magnet.\n Eclipse Hunter gives us Daren Solaris, who is so pretty that the series\' resident Tsundere bishoujo Action Girl goes into a mad rage when she sees that he normally wears glasses that disguise his prettiness, going as far as to tear his glasses off of his face and grind them into dust. LITERALLY.\n Most of the cast in \xbd Prince falls into this category. The game world requires your character resemble you, but lets people beautify themselves, and a lot of people look very lovely in game. Prince, who is actually a girl in real life and the only person playing an opposite gender in game, ends up being the single most bishie thing in existence. Only a few main characters don\'t take this route, with Wolf having a more mature look in real life and making himself uglier in the game, Gui turning out to be a bishie in real life and not altering his in game appearance. Nan Gong Zui, who makes himself look like a victim of Testosterone Poisoning in game, also turns out to have a very boyish appearance in the real world.\n Rowan in Chronicles Of Magic is known for his handsome, slender features and long blonde hair. Taunted by the soldiers with names like "pretty-boy" and "blondie".\n Valli from the Outlander Leander series is continuously described as beautiful. The main character, Leander, could be considered a bishounen as well. He mentions at one point that his dad wasn\'t sure if he would turn out pretty or handsome.\n Ax\'s human morph in the Animorphs series, due to being made from the DNA of the male and female Animorphs; it also leaves him with a mix of racial features making him difficult to place when he\'s in human morph.\n The boys in Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note\'s starting cast\u25ca are good-looking, but not this trope. But the characters added later mostly falls in this trope, in this cover\u25ca we have Sunahara (lower right) and Mikado (upper left)\u2014and the latter is officially recognized as "beautiful." The males spinoff series Genie Team G Jiken Note\'s starting cast\u25ca mostly falls into this trope.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Manhwa and Manhua\xa0\n A HUGE number of the characters in Ravages Of Time fall under this category. Most of the Water Mirror Eight Geniuses, Sima Yi, and the young members of the Yuan clan are all delicate-looking and gorgeous. Xiao Meng is the extreme, but well, he\'s an eunuch, so that comes with the territory.\n\n\n\n Since the vast majority of the characters in \xbd Prince are made in a video game they\'re all gorgeous (as players often make their characters so). The titular character is noted for being the most good-looking character, since they turned the pretty effect as high as it could possibly go.\n Let Dai: Jaehee is explicitly stated in-series to be very literally a "pretty boy", and the artwork makes that abundantly clear. It\'s one of the reasons that so many girls tend to go after him.\n Woojae from One has the nickname "Prince Charming" due to his good looks.\n Dong-whi from Nineteen, Twenty-One.\n Armand from Priest.\n Kyu Ra from Rure which fits with his "prince charming" image.\n Rai, Frank, Shinwoo, M-21 and Takeo from Noblesse.\n Id from Id is the very definition of this trope. Men and women alike fawn over his beauty. Though more often than not, every person he\'s met has initially thought him a woman.\n\n\n\n\n This is a nearly omnipresent trope in Chinese Wuxia adaptations. If the character is 1. A main or recurring supporting character. 2. Under 25, they\'re probably this.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n Gackt is a living breathing example of this. Even he admits it. In nine* nine, Gackt is shown some pictures of himself when he was younger, to which he responds, "I was a total bishonen back then...But now I\'m a biseinen." The difference being that bishonen technicality applies to only boys in their teens but biseinen applies to adults.\n Though most members of the kpop group NU\'EST could qualify(excluding Baekho), Ren is the most obvious example, bordering on Dude Looks Like a Lady with his big eyes and long hair.\n SHINee as a group can be described as this just after their debut when they decided to make a mini-drama looking like girls.\n Dong Bang Shin Ki\'s Jaejoong can very well pass as one. Many people say he\'s an anime character come\u25ca to\u25ca life\u25ca.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pinball\xa0\n Many of the Knights of the Round Table in Golden Logres have an unconventionally feminine appearance\u25ca.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theatre\xa0\n Since Takarazuka in Japan is composed entirely of female actors playing both male and female roles, it\'s no surprise that male roles often look a little Bishonen. Case in point, Wao Youka as The Phantom of the Opera, or Shizuka Asato (Zunko) as Der Tod from Elisabeth.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n Final Fantasy series: any of the main male characters, at least once graphics became advanced enough to portray it; the official character art shows that the older ones actually were this, too, when not depicted with blocky, low-resolution sprites. Specifically:\n Final Fantasy I: Warrior of Light, Final Fantasy II: Firion, Final Fantasy III: Luneth, Final Fantasy IV: Cecil, Final Fantasy V: Bartz, Final Fantasy VII: Cloud, Final Fantasy VIII: Squall, Final Fantasy IX: Zidane, Final Fantasy X: Tidus, Final Fantasy XII: Vaan, and Final Fantasy XV: Noctis. That is every leading male protagonist to date. And the Dissidia: Final Fantasy series includes all of them (except Noctis...and Luneth).\n Final Fantasy VII: Sephiroth. In the original cut of the scene with Sephiroth frozen in crystalized Mako, he was to have feminine curves to allude back to Jenova. Things were scaled back there for the same reason Squall in VIII was made to look more masculine.\n Now, now, let\'s not forget Zack Fair\u25ca.\n Dirge of Cerberus: Vincent Valentine.\n As for Kuja from Final Fantasy IX, he reaches truly Dude Looks Like a Lady proportions. This is even Lampshaded by Queen Brahne, who outright calls him a "girly-man". To be fair, though, he calls her "elephant-lady".\n Dissidia: Final Fantasy: Penelo, in the in-game manual:\nPenelo: Personally? I don\'t believe that boys should be prettier than I am.\n Final Fantasy II: Emperor Palamecia, anyone?\n If you look past the non-human features, Seymour from Final Fantasy X can fit the bill as well.\n Tetsuya Nomura, the designer for many of these characters, is a real-life Bishonen (see his page picture). A 40-year old Bishonen.\n Hope Estheim from the XIII-universe also counts, especially in the sequel.\n And then there\'s Vayne Solidor of Final Fantasy XII, who even in full armour is still a very slender guy with more hair than two out of the three women in the main party.\n A surprisingly large number of The King of Fighters\' main male characters are like this, with Ash Crimson pushing the androgyny to ridiculous levels.\n chaos (no capitalization) from Xenosaga\n \u014ckami has Waka, who FLIES seemingly by virtue of sheer Bishie Sparkle and his improbable headdress.\n Link from The Legend of Zelda, in his teen and adult incarnations. Comedy Central did base Xandir on him, after all. One gay magazine voted him "hottest game character", to the endlessly amusing horror of the teenage males in the fanbase. His incarnation in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess also places him in Hunk territory at the same time by showing off his body and having him partake in various manlier feats than usual.\n Kafei from The Legend of Zelda: Majora\'s Mask is a young version of this.\n Shad from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.\n Demon Lord Ghirahim from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.\n Kristoph Gavin and his brother, Klavier Gavin, from the Ace Attorney series. Max Galactica and Matt Engarde in Justice For All, as well.\n Most notably, the effeminate Max Galactica, with his flamboyance, camp, and pure fabulousness. (Because you, too, have stolen one of Max Galactica\'s many, many hearts.)\n And let\'s not forget our magenta-clad prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. He\'s so pretty that about five girls (and Oldbag) during the series get crushes on him... not that he notices.\n Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2. He was designed as an androgynously alluring blank slate for the player to project themself onto. There\'s a scene where another character makes a grab for his groin, and is surprised to find he is male. And you have to play as him naked. No, we are not making that up. He was widely reviled for this, among other reasons.\n Naturally, also his thinly-veiled parody in Metal Gear Solid 3, Raikov.\n Leon Kennedy of the Resident Evil series makes the cut, but barely. Even at his prettiest he was still quite solidly built and masculine, and his face becomes a little more chiseled and tough-looking in each new appearance. His haircut, though, remains top-shelf bishonen.\n Because of its Final Fantasy influences, Kingdom Hearts not only features bishonen leads from that series, but its original characters effectively form a Cast Full of Pretty Boys.\n Magna Carta: Tears of Blood kicks the Bishonen up to 11, making its main lead, Calintz, and his apprentice, Azel, almost entirely unrecognizable as male. Chris Arcway manages to dodge the bullet with his open button-up shirt and cocky womanizing attitude, but even Raul, the tall, masculine, goateed swordsman who appears a few times in the game, gets a touch of Bishie thanks to the artstyle (no matter how impossible it seems to be Bishie with a goatee).\n Quite a few male characters in the Disgaea series, including (but not limited to) Mid-boss, Seraph Lamington, Fukubei, Master Big star, Adell, and Tink.\n During the intro narration of Disgaea 4, a portrait of Tyrant Valvatorez drawn in a much more semi-realistic, shoujo-esque style than the simpler, more stylized art of the games is shown. This is the portrait in question\u25ca.\n Mitsumoto and Abyss in Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns.\n Ramirez from Skies of Arcadia seems to rock the "pretty but misunderstood" vibe as hard as he possibly can. Enrique is pretty much his good counterpart. A number of recruitable crew members further the bishounen appeal, particularly Lawrence and Ilchymis.\n The Tales Series is ripe with these:\n Although having more of a fairly (and by that, we mean in the smallest margin, as the game models differ slightly from the official art) masculine face than some other Tales Series Bishonen, Richard from Tales of Graces certainly fits the role, having traditional elements including medium-length blond hair, fancy frilly clothes, and immense popularity throughout the kingdom (in one skit, he mentions his "dilemma" with the sale of Richard-themed items). His seiyuu is even the same as a certain other Bishonen of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, and he even sports Zelos Wilder\'s costume as DLC. Doesn\'t help that his younger self can be seriously mistaken for a girl.\n Zelos from Tales of Symphonia. Yggdrasil, too. Some fans would argue that Kratos is one as well. The game is ripe with bishies. Kratos is a good example of a biseinen, or \'beautiful man\' - what a bishounen becomes when he grows up.\n Several of the guys in Tales of Vesperia: particularly Yuri, who can be mistaken for a woman until he opens his mouth.\n Guy, Luke and Asch from Tales of the Abyss If you count Jade as a verging-on Dude Looks Like a Lady biseinen that\'s the whole main male cast.\n Teddie\'s human form from Persona 4 was clearly designed with this in mind. He makes extensive use of the Bishie Sparkle to manipulate women that he comes across. Not to mention, during the crossdressing scene, he was the only one able to pull off looking like a girl. One male commentator from the audience even exclaims "I\'d hit that."\n Akihiko from Persona 3 certainly qualifies, being quite the Chick Magnet.\n In a less obvious manner, the main character (or Minato) may also qualify, having a very slender figure, subtle facial features, and pretty eyes. He\'s also frequently described as a "pretty boy" or "handsome", to the point where a certain Corrupt Corporate Executive tried to exploit him.\n From Persona 2: Innocent Sin, we have Jun, a character so pretty that many female characters look upon him in envy.\n Naoto Shirogane, also of Persona 4, appears to be one of these...but in a rare subversion, he is actually a she.\n It was an old joke in the fandom that those not familiar with the Mega Man X series would think that Zero was actually a girl, thanks to his Rapunzel Hair and what fans like to call the Booblights. This was even lampshaded by Bass of the original series, when, upon seeing Zero\'s blueprints, scoffs at Zero\'s appearance, thinking that he was "too girly" to be the strongest robot, like Dr. Wily, Zero\'s creator, claimed. And he seems to be quite a Chick Magnet, too; for both fellow Reploids and one human. What was Dr. Wily thinking when he created Zero and came up with that design, anyway? So much for being a threat to civilization...\n Word of God has it that Zero original concept WAS that of being a female robot. The booblights are probably remnants of this concept.\n The majority of Maverick bosses in the series have aggressive looking eyes with thin oval-shaped irises. However, the dragonfly Reploid named Commander Yammark from Mega Man X6 is the only one with big, bright eyes\u25ca with pronounced eyelashes\u25ca. This is why people thought he was female.\n Harvest Moon:\n Julius, Jamie, Tim/Trent, Alex, and Skye.\n Will from Harvest Moon: Sunshine Islands bears more than a passing resemblance to the above-pictured Tamaki.\n It\'s easier to name guys that aren\'t bishonen in more recent games.\n Similarly, many of the young males in the spinoff series Rune Factory are bishonen. The newest protagonist barely looks male, which, what with the Hello, Insert Name Here nature of the game, can lead to some unintentionally hilarious moments:\n"Sophie? What a fine, manly name!"\n Time Crisis\'s newer protagonists.\n Sengoku Basara:\n Uesugi Kenshin takes this far enough that fans seriously doubt he\'s really male. Granted, the games also have Motonari, Keiji, Mitsuhide, and Hanbe, but Kenshin is still the reigning king/queen.\n Keiji is a strange case, as he has a muscular figure but a very pretty face and long, silky hair. And Yukimura also seems to become more feminine looking with each new installment.\n Dynasty Warriors has its fair share, with Jin (Sima Yi, Sima Shi, Sima Zhao, Zhong Hui, Xiahou Ba, Jia Chong, Wen Yang) being a certified Cast Full of Pretty Boys. The other kingdoms don\'t fail to deliver however with Shu (Zhao Yun, Jiang Wei, Guan Suo, Guan Xing, Zhang Bao), Wu (Zhou Yu, Lu Xun, Ling Tong), and especially Wei (Zhang He, Cao Pi, Guo Jia) hosting some impressive examples.\n Samurai Warriors: we have Mitsuhide, Hanbei, Ranmaru, Kiyomasa, Motochika, and Kojiro.\n Don\'t forget Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, Mistunari Ishida and Azai Nagamasa.\n Testament of Guilty Gear, who, in addition to his long black hair and androgynous face, has an outfit consisting of a man-bra and a skirt that shows a decent amount of leg. And that\'s not going anywhere near Bridget. There\'s also Ky.\n Fire Emblem:\n Lucius, the amazingly feminine featured pretty boy monk with long blond hair. Of course, he defends the fact that he is male when confronted by Serra.\n A typical Fire Emblem game will have several bishonen, at least a couple of rugged manly men, a few good looking grandpas, and a Gonk or two. Few are as bafflingly pretty as Lucius, though.\n When Super Smash Bros. first showed off Marth, most western players were intially quite confused as to whether Marth was a girl or not. His voice actor cleared this up a bit, though.\n Libra in Fire Emblem Awakening takes this to such ridiculous levels he invokes Stupid Sexy Flanders and Even the Guys Want Him in-universe. Oh, and he has a very feminine voice too.\n Less so than Libra, but the Type 01 build for a male Robin is fairly bishonen, especially if you give him long hair.\n Pit from Kid Icarus: Uprising and his dark counterpart likely qualify also.\n Taichi in CROSS\x86CHANNEL has a rather androgynous but attractive appearance. He, on the other hand, is convinced he is horribly ugly for reasons that are never really revealed.\n Pretty much any guy from the NeoRomance series (Angelique, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de, Kin\'iro no Corda). Eisen of Haruka proved to be pretty enough to disguise himself as a girl on one occasion; even the Emperor is bishounen, though he has the excuse of being Eisen\'s half-brother. In the La Corda d\'Oro anime, one character (Kenichi Shimizu) actually gets called a bishounen by the lead girl when she first meets him.\n Among the attractive male characters in Infinite Space, a few of them fall into bishonen/biseinen category. Lord Roth is arguably the best example, with his waist-length lavender hair and feminine face. Main character Yuri is quite pretty himself.\n Pok\xe9mon Black and White has N, as well as Cilan, Chili, and Cress. Cheren and Hilbert qualify as well.\n Bishonen characters in other games include Falkner, Bugsy, Morty, Will, Wallace, Steven, Roark, Volkner, Riley, Aaron, Lucian, and Marlon. Maxie may count as well, even though he\'s older than the others.\n The male player characters have been trending toward this. Calem, the male player character for X and Y, is probably the most blatant example - especially when compared to Red\'s original game design. Or for previous gens,compare the remake designs to their original ones.\n WarioWare has Young Cricket, who is popular among Japanese female players for being the only bish\u014dnen in the series.\n Dragon Quest has two bishonen: Psaro the Manslayer (Human form) and Angelo.\n Castlevania. Alucard is one of the quintessential examples. Mistaking him for a girl is not likely to be a problem, though, given the loving attention put into his sprite and the fact that his VA has a very, very deep voice. Several other protagonists in later Castlevania titles, such as Juste Belmont and Soma Cruz, are this as well.\n Yuuto is the only male in Eien no Aselia that could really be described as pretty. On the other hand, he\'s also pretty muscular by the end, so despite the face, he isn\'t exactly girly.\n Joshua from The World Ends with You, complete with a girlish giggle to boot.  Being something of a higher plane of existence probably helps.\n Street Fighter:\n Vega, the Spanish ninja. It\'s even part of his character. Vega is a narcissist who believes his face to be extremely beautiful, and cannot stand the ugly. Part of it comes from traumatization as a child when his ugly father killed his beautiful mother. He also wears a mask, not to hide his identity, but to prevent his face from being scarred. Remy in Street Fighter III is even more of one (though he\'s not narcissistic like Vega).\n In the Alpha series, Ken becomes one of these, with long, flowing hair in a ponytail and a younger face (some pieces of art\u25ca for the game even show him with pronounced lips, a rarity for Street Fighter characters). However, the other games show him looking older and more muscular, with Perma Stubble.\n Prince Peasley from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, who makes the whole screen gleam - literally - when he tosses his hair.\n The main character of Shadow of the Colossus.\n Bushido Blade 1 and 2 have Katze.\n Also, Kaun.\n The Suikoden series of games have, quite literally, dozens of bishonen among the ranks of the Stars of Destiny (108 per game!). Notable ones include and are not limited to: every main protagonist, Flik, Luc and Sasarai, and Yuber.\n Sergei from Asura\'s Wrath. Yasha is to an extent too, though not quite as much.\n Many of the characters of Eternal Sonata are well-noted for this, including the game\'s main character Frederic Chopin and the main on-screen avatar character, Allegretto.\n In Bayonetta 2, the Masked Lumen is one under his mask, with sharp, almost elven features and flowing, waist-length platinum-blonde hair. The impressive thing is you can tell he\'s one when just a sliver of his mask gets knocked off, revealing only one of his eyes and the general shape of his features around it.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Visual Novels\xa0\n Higurashi: When They Cry\'s Keiichi is noticeably pretty, and even sparkles a couple of times, as well as Satoshi, who is a more extreme example than Keiichi and is even voiced by a female.\n Umineko: When They Cry has the absolutely adorable Kanon, not to mention Battler. George was made to be this in the anime and the Updated Re-release for the Playstation 3, but in the original sound novels he\'s rather plain in comparison to Kanon and Battler.\n Yukito from Air. As well as a Silver-Haired Tall, Dark and Snarky Ineffectual Loner, he later shares some traits with The Doctor himself!\n Yo-Jin-Bo is a Cast Full of Pretty Boys. Since it\'s a Romance Game, it\'s kind of expected. Bo is considered so pretty he\'s practically female by the other characters; he\'s annoyed when a crossdresser hits on him, but plays this to his advantage and says he should be allowed to guard the Princess during her bath because he "looks androgynous" with his long hair and wouldn\'t disturb her as much as the other guys.\n Heinz Heger in Shikkoku No Sharnoth.\n In Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! Touma is the most notable contender, but Cap also fits, both of them with fan clubs.\n Fate/stay night features Gilgamesh, the ancient King of Mesopotania, who\xb4s apparently a tall, white, red-eyed blonde who\xb4s commented on by one of the main heroines as "he looked like a model". It seems that A+ Charisma skill is justified. Too bad he\xb4s a giant douche with an ego the size of the Universe until Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, where he drinks a potion of youth and becomes an adorable well-mannered kid who wouldn\xb4t hurt anyone. His child version is of course equally Bishonen.\n Hatoful Boyfriend is the dating sim where almost all of the love interests are pigeons. The exceptions are a quail and a partridge. There is the option to see a pseudohuman alternate appearance at the introduction of each one, and these are all quite bishie even when that doesn\'t really fit the bird or the character (the middle-aged "fat bird" or "fluffy heretic" is just as svelte and pretty as the ones represented as teenaged boys). The only exception is Okosan, who\'s only portrayed as a bird in a school uniform.\n Being a BL game, all of the main characters in DRAMAtical Murder are bishonen. However, most of the protagonists are over 20, so they would technically be considered biseinen.\n Kyousuke from Little Busters!!. Mio outright calls him a bishounen one time. And in the Mask the Saito OVA, at one point he dramatically tears off his mask at sunset and sparkles fly as his hair shakes. (The sparkles being his tears from when he was crying because he was so touched a moment before, but still...)\n Mizuho in Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru. Of course. That being said, he is quite pretty even when not dressing as a girl.\n Pretty much the entire cast of Gakuen Heaven.\n Takuma and Hamaji from H2O: Footprints in the Sand.\n Just about every male in Togainu no Chi, especially Rin and Akira.\n Pretty much the entire male cast of Uta no Prince-sama.\n The five male leads from Hiiro No Kakera.\n In Akatsuki No Goei Kaito claims his greatest skill is that he\'s really hot. He kind of has a point given that he can just sit down and read in public and girls will instantly come flirt with him.\n Many male characters are this in Starry&#9734;Sky.\n Asagao Academy Normal Boots Club has Jared, AKA ProJared, according to his character description he\'s the most attractive person in school. He even sparkles!\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Web Comics\xa0\n Not your typical Mad Scientist, Professor T.X. from M9 Girls! is pretty much the embodiment of this trope.\n In Girl Genius, the artist Phil Foglio made a drawing of a "bishie j\xe4ger" in jest to his wife and co-writer Kaja. At her insistence, it was developed into the purple Long-Haired Pretty Boy we know now as Maxim. Despite being a pretty boy, he\'s still a J\xe4germonster in every sense of the state.\n Wren the protagonist of White Noise, who doubles as a Long-Haired Pretty Boy. This can lead to quite a bit of Viewer Gender Confusion.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/shot285.png', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'A - H',

plays "Spot the Good Guy."\n"If she were good, she wouldn\'t be so ugly."\n\u2014Jake the Dog, Adventure Time\nIf a character is beautiful, then that character is a good person, either publicly or secretly. If a character is good, then that character will either be beautiful or be treated as beautiful.\nOr to put it another way, every hero worth his salt must be physically attractive, or at the very least, better-looking than half of other people his or her age. This standard is more relaxed for side characters who can be truly ordinary-looking or even literal aliens, but expect the lead character to be pleasing to look at, even if he is the alien.\nIt almost goes without saying that this is very old; an attempt was even made in the 19th Century to quantify this attitude into the "science" of physiognomy, which posited a direct correlation between appearance and moral character.\nThis trope\'s influence is felt on many others:\n In older works, may be a factor in Make Up Is Evil: only an evil character would have no natural beauty and so have to resort to paint.\n Ugly Guy, Hot Wife both averts this and plays it straight\u2014unattractive men are shown to be good husband material, yet it still works on the assumption that because the wife is hot, that he was lucky in love even if nothing else is known about her.\n Gorgeous Gorgon may play this trope straight or just plain play with it depending on the gorgon.\n Always Lawful Good races will almost always play this straight, sometimes to the point of inhuman beauty.\n The Beautiful Elite usually plays it straight, but may not apply it if they are so beautiful that they don\'t seem human.\n Red Right Hand, where a specific ugly or inhuman feature marks a character as evil.\n Adaptational Heroism usually goes hand-in-hand with Adaptational Attractiveness.\n Historical Hero Upgrade often leads to Historical Beauty Update as well.\nThe failed subversion of Suetiful All Along is common.\nFor animals and more nonhuman characters, see What Measure Is a Non-Cute?.\nCompare Evil Makes You Ugly. The opposite of this trope is Beauty Is Bad and Evil Is Sexy, although they aren\'t mutually exclusive with this one. Ugly Hero, Good-Looking Villain is a specific inversion. Contrast Hot Guys Are Bastards, Divinely Appearing Demons and Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon. See also Expecting Someone Taller.\nAs this trope is ubiquitous, please only add egregious cases. Invoked and defied examples are the best ones.\n\nExamples:\n Literature\n(Mostly) Straight examples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Anime and Manga \xa0\n In the DVD Commentary for Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, the director laments that he asked the animators to make sure a young female character was NOT cute. But they just couldn\'t help themselves.\n Gundam examples (basic fact: since about Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam nearly all major characters were relatively beautiful unrelated to their alignment. Even the franchises\' morally ambiguous masked men hardly ever were them to hide ugly scars and the like.\n The most obvious subversion would be Dozle Zabi. While the ugliest of the Zabi family by far, he\'s also probably the nicest aside from Garma. His final act in the One Year War is to Hold the Line to buy time for his wife and daughter to get to safety.\n Discussed in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: When OZ goes to apprehend Duo\'s space shuttle, Lady Une muses that they should kill the pilot if he\'s attractive but let him live if he\'s ugly. Her reason: they can use an ugly pilot as a scapegoat when they do bad stuff; but if the pilot is handsome, the people would be more likely to sympathize and follow him. Her orders, however, are just to kill him. In the actual series, everyone is attractive, so it\'s the same difference.\n Bish\u014dnen Rokudo Mukuro from Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, shown before to be a horrible, Manipulative Bastard with no regard for human life, is later given a few humanizing traits and is depicted as not being completely evil, with hints that he\'s just being stubborn with hiding that he doesn\'t really hate Tsuna anymore (most notably stated by Tsuna, who is convinced that he is, deep down, not such a bad person). He\'s still pretty darn evil, though.\n In Bio-Meat: Nectar, the older and uglier you are, the more likely you will be a completely nasty person who gets eaten alive.\n When the Rogue Titan makes its debut in Attack on Titan the audience immediately knows it to be different from the other titans as it not only saved Mikasa from being eaten, but possesses a far more toned and better proportioned body than the average titan.\n This was even lampshaded by Mikasa in the Abridged On Titan web series where she refers to the Rogue Titan as the "Sexy Titan."\n Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z: When they first encounter each other, Blossom and Mojo Jojo get along just fine, and Blossom instructs Mojo on a good way to eat a sandwich cookie. However, when they both realize that one of them is beautiful and the other is ugly, they realize that they must be enemies, and they start fighting.\n Played straight in Noblesse. Are you ugly? Get yourself a life insurance. Are you hot? Redemption road is right over there. Curiously, this does not apply to female characters who die anyway.\n Played straight in Dance in the Vampire Bund. All the vampires can turn into a true form. Guess who\'s true form looks like a center fold with some strategically placed armor.\n Inverted in Death Note as the Kiras are all conventionally attractive while the good guys are an albino, a skinny guy with messy hair and a guy with a disfiguring facial scar (although they are considered attractive by the fandom). This may be a subverted inversion (if there is such a thing) because the Kiras are technically the main characters, or at least one of them.\n One Piece:\n There are many good-looking bad guys and bad-looking good guys but Chapter 764 is a little special: Every single grotesque person is a heartless Doctor (and Nurse) Jerk who turned away a dying child  future badass pirate surgeon Trafalgar Law because they thought he was contagious (he wasn\'t, his disease was caused by pollution). Fortunately being ugly made it easier to watch the boy\'s companion  Corazon, incredibly Big Bad Doflamingo\'s secretly kindhearted brother destroy them and their hospitals.\n It turns out Sabo himself is a noble and is the only child noble who looks attractive, especially when compared to the Gonk looking spoiled brats. He\'s also a Token Good Teammate.\n JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure reveals that Dio Brando has at least four sons. The first son introduced, Giorno, is The Hero of his own part. The other three are working for Dio\'s disciple and close friend, Enrico Pucci.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ballads\xa0\n In Child Ballad "Sir Aldingar", the mysterious, possibly angelic champion who fights for the queen.\nA louelie child was hee;\n In the ballad "Zu Bacharach am Rheine" by the Romantic poet Clemens Brentano, the world is first introduced to Brentano\'s creation, the magic-wielding Loreley, who brought doom on whomever fell in love with her. The local bishop has her arraigned before his ecclesiastical court, but he cannot condemn her because she is so beautiful:\nDer Bischof lie\xdf sie laden\nVor geistliche Gewalt -\nUnd mu\xdfte sie begnaden,\nSo sch\xf6n war ihr Gestalt.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Comic Books \xa0\n Jack Kirby\'s Eternals are physical specimens of godlike perfection, while the Deviants are hideously mutated.\n Subverted, as about half of the Eternals are jerks, while the Deviants aren\'t that evil. Played straight with Thanos of Titan, who is an eternal but had the latent Deviant gene. His brother is handsome and the demigod of love, while Thanos is monstrous, with purple skin, black eyes and a wrinkled chin and completely evil.\n And Karkas, whom everyone acknowledges to be the most hideous Deviant, is a Defector from Decadence and one of the good guys.\n X-Men is often pretty good about averting this by having heroes like the Beast who have really freakish mutations, or Wolverine (arguably the most famous of the X-Men) being depicted, both in the art and by the other characters, as a "short, square-built, hairy and smelly man". However, note that almost all of the "grotesque but benevolent" mutants in the X-canon are male. There\'s a definite double standard there. And they\'re still frequently drawn as being generically attractive.\n In an arc of X-Men spinoff New Mutants, one of the characters, Karma, was possessed by the evil Shadow King, who caused her to become morbidly obese from overeating. In the following arc (after Karma rejoins the team), Karma is promptly (and conveniently) dropped into a desert where she sheds her fat in record time and becomes hot again.\n Perhaps the biggest X-Men example is Marrow, a Morlock with the Lovecraftian Superpower of pulling her own bones out to use as weapons. She first appeared as a terrorist; she was distinctly unattractive, with random bones sticking out of her body and skin like a prune. When the decision was later made to revive the character as an X-Man, she inexplicably becomes a pouty-lipped babe with flawless skin. She did still have the bones sticking out, but later those went away too.\n When Rogue originally appeared, she was A) a villain, and B) drawn to be very butch and homely. Nowadays...\n In New Mutants number 47 (entitled "My Heart for the Highlands"), several of the team find themselves in 14th century Scotland and fight on behalf of Robert the Bruce. Afterward, Doug Ramsey has a question, and the answer implies this trope:\n Doug: Pardon my asking sir, but\u2014Aren\'t you afraid of us? We pop up out of nowhere, wielding fantastic powers. You\'ve only our word that we\'re not demons or worse.\n Robert the Bruce: True Douglas\u2014But any hadesspawn able to assume so young an innocent, an\' noble a seeming deserves our respect rather than our fear\u2014for that demon has become more human than most men.\n In ElfQuest, the distinction between in-group (elves) and out-group (humans and trolls) has been striking from the get-go. Elves are the embodiment of otherworldly beauty, while Humans Are Ugly and idiosyncratic and trolls are bulbous and warty. While a few humans and the occasional troll are easy on the eyes, they are nothing compared to the elves \u2014 even evil elves, even genocidal elves, they\'re never ugly. See, humans are the enemy and trolls are untrustworthy, but "All elves are one". You can kill humans and trolls in self-defense, but Elves Don\'t Kill Elves no matter the provocation. Recent years have seen these principles change. More and more humans have been joining the list of allies, so the in-group/out-group distinction is weakening significantly. The "Elves Don\'t Kill Elves" prohibition has been broken on a few occasions and no longer elicits the agonizing guilt that Strongbow felt over Kureel (the first such killing). Now that Wendy Pini isn\'t [always] doing the art herself, certain artists draw humans all but indistinguishable from elves (which means as beautiful as elves). They look so similar that a human wearing ceremonial elf ears leaves you wondering, not about the ears, but if his thumb and four fingers are a mistake \u2014 a confusion that would never have been possible in the early books. The whole thing is at least mildly justified, anyway: elves are a different species from both humans and trolls, usually have access to healing magic that the latter don\'t, and their ancestors deliberately took forms that would appeal to humans in preparation for making contact (they just didn\'t count on getting thrown thousands of years backwards in time and losing most of their magic in the process). Word of God has it that the Wolfriders, the tribe who had to fight humans most often, even went out of their way to deliberately prevent or eliminate scars whenever possible in order to present a more formidable face to their enemies, who\'d just have been encouraged by the notion that their weapons could actually leave marks on the \'forest spirits\'.\n Many Batman villains are deformed in some way - The Joker\'s skin is bleached white and he has a permanent smile, Two-Face is scarred down half of his body, Mr Freeze\'s skin is an unearthly white, Clayface is a giant goop monster, Killer Croc is reptilian in appearance, and the Penguin resembles his namesake animal. In fairness, though, most of the time these deformities are part of what caused them to become villainous in the first place, and there are a few better looking villains like Poison Ivy. (Oddly, those characters all seem to be female. Funny how that works.)\n Tintin ("Tintin The Calculus Affair"). Tintin and Captain Haddock witness their friend Professor Calculus being carried off by mysterious figures, when another group ambushes them. When Haddock asks which side they should help, Tintin evokes this trope by telling him to hit the ugliest ones. Haddock is then confronted by two brawling mooks, each as ugly as the other. So he bangs their heads together. (As it turns out, the "rescuers" are trying to kidnap Calculus as well).\n Played laughably straight in almost anything by Jack Chick. In fact, people go ugly as soon as we find out they disagree with Jack. The only exception is that strange tract about homosexuality, where Satan is constantly shirtless and has obviously been working out. Is there something you want to tell us, Jack?\n Dick Tracy villains are almost universally malformed and ugly. Prune Face is the most extreme example. The hero, by contrast, is a handsome square-jawed detective.\n Played oh-so straight for years on end with the family of Captain Marvel villain Dr. Sivana. Sivana himself could be kindly described as a stunted little troll with no hair and a face only a mother could love: evil. He has four kids. Georgia is her father, only female and with hair: evil. Thaddeus is his dad mark 2: evil. Magnificus apparently comes from a completely different family, with golden hair and absolutely no deformities: good. Beautia, winner of the All-Time Prize for Least Subtle Name, is absolutely stunning: good. Captain Marvel himself: physically Superman in red, and the hero.\n Nancy Callahan in Sin City is the most noble and innocent character in the series and is described as the most beautiful.\n Captain America is the perfect male specimen, especially by Nazi standards, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a perfect body. His Arch-Enemy Red Skull has a red skull.\n One Doctor Who annual strip from the 1970s, "The Traitor", displayed a really literal example. The Human Alien civilisation in the story has \'a psyche that is their form\' and anyone significantly hideous is invariably murderous, stupid and evil. The planet the Doctor has landed on is their form of an \'asylum\', a planet where the suns give out a special radiation that allows these people to live normal lives. The Doctor cluelessly helps them off the planet, and when they\'re away in the spaceship they transform into horrible monsters - the Doctor then tricks them back into returning to the planet for their own good and cries about it in the final panel. It\'s pretty grim for a strip aimed at eight-year-olds.\n Archie Comics are pretty bad for this. If a character shows up in a comic who looks mean or ugly, you can bet dollars to donuts he\'s a rotten guy with no redeeming traits. Ethel Muggs started out as an Abhorrent Admirer / Stalker with a Crush and was pretty hard on the eyes, but as the comics have gone on she\'s been redesigned to be quite pretty along with being a much nicer and likable person (compare her old and new designs\u25ca). The only subversion to this is Cheryl Blossom because she\'s played up as a rival and enemy of Betty and Veronica, and she\'s not that bad to begin with since she\'s basically a Rich Bitch who does have some genuinely redeeming qualities.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fairy Tales\xa0\n In "The Blue Parrot", this is tweaked but ultimately played straight. The daughter of the swan fairy is shocked that the handsome portrait she had fallen in love with belongs to such a rude man \u2014 but they soon discover that he\'s an imposter. Rescuing the true king finds him both courteous and handsome.\n The illustrations play it straight for Hermosa, the swan fairy\'s daughter, and Riquette, Ismenor\'s daughter. Hermosa is depicted as beautiful, while Riquette is depicted as ugly and apelike.\n Similarly in "The Colony of Cats" \u2014 the older cats rebuke the kittens, saying that all the servants can\'t be pretty, but Peppina proves to be as bad as she is ugly, where Lizina was pretty and good.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Fanfiction \xa0\n An absolutely ubiquitous trope in fanfiction, to the point that canonically villainous characters who happen to be attractive may be portrayed as good guys simply for looking attractive. In some fanfics, a hero noticing that a canonical villain looks hot will actually be used in place of a Heel\x96Face Turn as though being hot makes their prior evil actions irrelevant. Look at any Harry Potter fanfic in which Hermione discovers she\'s pure-blood to see this in action.\n Aside from the above, Electro is described as being quite ugly in Calvin and Hobbes: The Series. This is notable, as the other heroes aren\'t particularly beautiful either.\n Knowledge is Power: Many words are spent on how ugly the antagonists are (as well as how beautiful the male protagonists\' wives and girlfriends are). Notably, Millicent\'s shift from rapist to love interest (in a "Humour/Romance" fic!) is accompanied by her working out and losing weight.\n Pokeumans: Asula the Milotic, regarded as the most beautiful Pokemon species, serves as the Big Good of the story.\n Emphasized in Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles by the narration regarding Hermione.\nA woman taking pride in her appearance is honoring the Lord; because after all, it is the Lord who gave her a pretty face and nice hair. Taking care of that is important! Harry got the feeling that Hermione was as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.\n Jack is easily the cutest-looking character in the entirety of Cave Story Versus IM Meen, and he is the main protagonist.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Animated\xa0\n Quite a few Disney Animated Canon movies have caught flak for playing this straight. In The Little Mermaid we had the grossly overweight Ursula; same with Radcliffe of Pocahontas in comparison to the Adonis-like John Smith. Then there\'s Cinderella\'s ugly step-siblings (although one of them, Anastasia, gets Progressively Prettier in the sequels when she grows some conscience), the rakishly-thin Jafar of Aladdin, and the monstrous-looking Huns of Mulan.\n In Epic the Boggans are ugly, and the animals they use as mounts (bats, crows and a star-nosed mole) are ones that are generally disliked by humans. Whereas the Leafmen are all good-looking, and ride hummingbirds.\n Cars 2 actually both plays this straight and inverts this: The good guys are a shiny American racecar, a pair of shiny British spy cars, and a rusty American tow truck, while the bad guys are all mean, beaten-up Lemons, led by  a malfunctioning British SUV posing as an electric car.\n The Lion King II: Simba\'s Pride features a rare, justified version of this trope. The Outsider lions are scraggly and have duller, scruffier coats. But that\'s because they were living in a barren wasteland and likely had poor diets, so naturally they were going to be leaner and their coats would be less bright. By the end,  the outsider lions come to live in the pridelands and they have the same body build as the rest of the prideland lions.\n Cinderella 3D: The titular and good Cinderella is the most beautiful of all the characters, whereas the step mother and her daughters are as ugly inside as they look.\n Faeries1999 had the good, beautiful faeries vs. the evil, ugly Shapeshifter and his minions. Though the Prince does hint they\'re ugly because they\'re evil.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n Made explicit in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Clint Eastwood\'s character is, at best, a cold-blooded antihero and con artist, but because he is the most handsome he is "The Good." The other characters fuss over his good looks, particularly his beautiful blond hair. Lee Van Cleef\'s trademark was his crooked, hawkish nose. Early in his career many suggested that without plastic surgery he would be typecast as a villain (which he was). In the film he plays a ruthless hitman and is "The Bad." (despite in the other Sergio Leone film For a Few Dollars More, Van Cleef played the hero who bests Eastwood and the villain). The unconventionally handsome Eli Wallach was cast as "The Ugly", despite being much better looking than Van Cleef. The movie went so far as to actually show us their labels with on-screen text, just so there would be no confusion. There was at least one subversion, though, in the villain being called "Angel Eyes".\n "The Ugly" would ironically have been played by the rather handsome Gian Maria Volonte, but Leone wanted it to be a funny character, so Wallach was cast for comedic talent and to give the role a scruffy, schlubby appearance. The point of the character was that he was ugly on the inside in any case. Furthermore, some viewers might consider his weight to be rather attractive.\n Speaking of Van Cleef and Volonte, For a Few Dollars More inverts this by having Volonte as the monstrous villain El Indio, and Van Cleef as the noble Colonel Mortimer.\n Zig-zagged with The Good, the Bad, the Weird. Do-won, "The Good", is ridiculously good looking, but so is the "Bad", Chang-yi. However the "Weird", Tae-goo, who is stout and pudgy, was, at least in his past, arguably the most morally repellent.\n Star Wars plays this straight with all human characters, to the point that Revenge of the Sith shows both Palpatine becoming the way he looked in the original trilogy within minutes of the Jedi discovering he\'s a Sith Lord, and Darth Vader lost his once good looks shortly after turning to the dark side.\n In The Wizard of Oz, the Good Witches are pretty, and the Wicked Witches are ugly. Glinda says straight up that "Only bad witches are ugly". (This sentiment is deconstructed and subverted by Wicked.)\n Which makes Glinda into kind of a bitch when you realize the first question she asked Dorothy when she got to Oz was, "Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?"\n In Glinda\'s defense Dorothy is pretty young, so she may have been under the impression that Dorothy was a kind of witch in training of sorts.\n Also, she never said that all bad witches are ugly; only that only bad witches are ugly.\n The Witch of the West was originally going to be played by the beautiful Gale Sondergaard. She was replaced with the considerably less attractive Margaret Hamilton. Though many consider Hamilton\'s version Evil Is Sexy.\n Conversed and played completely straight in the sequel to Zenon. When the aliens finally show up at the end, they are Energy Beings who travel in a butterfly/manta ray style space ship that shifts between pastel, Easter egg colors of pink, blue, yellow, etc. When a character asks if these aliens might be hostile, Zenon replies, with no irony and a completely straight face, "Nobody could have a ship that beautiful and be evil." She was right, they were good aliens who saved their lives and repaired the space station.\n At the start of Unbreakable, Samuel L. Jackson describes a comic cover in art-critic detail, commenting on the villain\'s inhumanely big head. At the end of the movie, he reveals to the hero that he was always meant to be the villain because of his brittle bones. "They called me \'Mr. Glass\'"\n This trope is always so much fun to observe whenever Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots pop up. If the story is focusing on Mary, she will be rather pretty, whilst Elizabeth will look like an ugly old hag. But if it\'s Elizabeth in the spotlight, she\'s always portrayed as having far more grace and beauty, whilst Mary is transformed into a woman whose bitterness is shown quite clearly on her plain (if she\'s lucky) face. Expect the ugly one to have crows\' feet, and any ugly Elizabeth will have hair exactly the wrong shade of red and far too much white makeup on. The irony of this is that both Elizabeth and Mary would have been seen as absolutely freaking gorgeous in our time at age twenty-five - they both resembled Nicole Kidman in face and in body. Neither of them aged as well, but what can you expect in the 16th century?\n This comes in three layers in The Tale of Despereaux. The cute mouse and porcelain-skinned princess are good, the plain but not hideous Mig and Rascuro are susceptible to evil urges, and the ugly other rats are Always Chaotic Evil. Although the movie does state that the princess was partly at fault, for being rude to Mig and flat-out screaming at Rascuro when he tries to apologize.\n Kind of an interesting play on this in Inglourious Basterds; the more sympathetic Germans (especially Bridget, who\'s a spy for the British) are also more attractive, while the more evil Germans are decidedly unattractive.\n In I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, anyone who disagrees with gay marriage (or homosexuality in general) is noticeably unattractive. Watch again and you\'ll see. Characters who are borderline attractive are also on the fence regarding gay rights, and invariably back up the titular couple in the end. Obviously, this isn\'t so much "good and evil" as it is "backing up our message with visual cues," but still.\n Tim Burton\'s Alice in Wonderland plays this trope straight. The White Queen is gorgeous and Alice is pretty as well, whereas the Red Queen is very strange-looking. But it also seriously subverts it with the Mad Hatter and  the Bandersnatch. And also Tweedle-Dee, Tweedle-Dum, and the March Hare. It\'s also worth pointing out that the Red Queen herself is aware of this trope, telling her sister at one point that she can\'t get her way for once just by blinking her "pretty eyes".\n Played straight in the film version of Matilda. All the evil characters are either unattractive or just average, whereas Matilda\'s heaven-sent teacher Miss Honey is probably the only good looking person in the movie. Not counting the cute little innocent kids, that is. This gets a bit silly when the tackily-made-up, unattractively-voiced Mrs. Wormwood starts lecturing Miss Honey about the merits of books versus looks. That\'s how it was in the book as well. If anything, the drawings of Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood were uglier than their live action counterparts (Mr. Wormwood looked a bit like a rodent and Mrs. Wormwood is described as being plump, with obviously-dyed hair and a "suet-pudding" face).\n Played very straight in Solomon Kane, where Kane in the start is ragged and crazy-looking with his messy beard and hair, and his crazy Large Ham expressions, but after doing Heel\x96Face Turn he smoothes out his facial hair and becomes ruggedly handsome. Likewise, when The Dragon recruits warriors, he does some kind of demonic possession-thing where the recruits receive horrible scars, black eyes and bad teeth, all which go away when they die. Oh, and The Dragon himself is horribly scarred under his mask, and the Big Bad invokes Two-Faced appearance with his tattoos.\n Played depressingly straight in Star Trek: Insurrection. The Bak\'u look like catalog models, while the Son\'a look like Michael Jackson after 20 too many facelifts.\n John Wayne\'s 1968 pro-Vietnam War project The Green Berets played this straight with a young George Takei as a handsome South Vietnamese commander, and his Viet Cong counterpart as anything but.\n In Oz: The Great and Powerful, all three witches appear beautiful at first. Her stunning appearance is what convinces Oz that Glinda is good, though given his The Casanova character, it\'s not perhaps astounding that a pretty face turns his head.\n It\'s implied that the Super Soldier serum in Captain America: The First Avenger horrifically mutates bad men and amplifies the attractiveness in good ones. This would explain the Red Skull\'s deformation and Steve getting more buff.\n Played straight with Adam in I, Frankenstein. At first, he\'s very obviously a creature stitched from different parts, as shown by the stitches on his face. However, throughout the movie, the stitches get less and less noticeable. By the end, he could easily pass for a human with a few scars. It doesn\'t hurt that he looks like Aaron Eckhart. This signifies him moving away from being a mindless animal who is only out for himself and finding a purpose in life and developing a soul. Averted with the gargoyles and the demons. They both look unattractive in their true form, while their human appearances vary.\n The Autobots in the Transformers Film Series have humanoid appearances so that audiences can identify as them as the good guys. They have humanoid faces and bodies and five-fingered hands, even Jetfire. Also, they always talk in English, even when there are no humans around. Sentinel Prime subverts it. Meanwhile, most Decepticons have animalistic appearances and communicate with animal noises and Cybertronian language, in order to highlight their alien nature.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n Joked at in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air with Hilary.\nHilary: Heaven is this place where everyone is beautiful. And hell is, like, The Valley.\n Perhaps surprisingly, given its self-awareness, Buffy the Vampire Slayer often falls victim to this trope. Apart from the Slayers themselves (who are all stunning), all the other major good guy characters are attractive, even Hollywood Homely Willow, while the demons are usually hideous. True, there are some good looking villains, (Spike, Angelus, Faith, etc.), but most of these characters were either very minor or ended up performing a Heel\x96Face Turn, or ended up looking really, really monstrous. Glory is the only good-looking seasonal Big Bad who was presented entirely without sympathy. (Although The First, able to look like anyone it wants to as long as it\'s dead and given to appearing like Buffy, might count.) And, of course, Willow was recast from the pilot to be cuter. The original tends to be known on the Internet as "Fat Willow", with forum posters complaining about how the show would have been ruined...\n While everyone on Supernatural is ridiculously pretty, this trope was directly referenced in the episode "Folsom Prison Blues", in which Dean and Sam are thrown in jail. While their female lawyer keeps hearing that Dean\'s a monster, she changes her mind completely and helps them out when he uses his looks to convince her he\'s innocent.\n May or may not have been intentional with Charmed. Piper, Phoebe, Paige, and Prue are all gorgeous women. Although their enemies in the first season were commonly monstrous looking, and when they began to look like ordinary humans, they were usually greasy and dirty looking, as if they\'d been living in a cave.\n Although quite subverted with the evil Zankou, who is implied to have had a relationship with the stunning Seer, Kyra.\n Heroes is a pretty big offender. You can always tell the new character is a good guy if they look like a model. Sylar and Adan Monroe are the only exceptions.\n Battlestar Galactica (2003):\n Played uncomfortably straight with the Cylons\u2014the good (or at least sympathetic) Cylons are played by attractive young actors and actresses (Six, Boomer/Athena, D\'Anna, Anders, Chief Tyrol), the more morally doubtful (Leoben, Tigh) are older and less conventionally attractive, and the outright evil (Cavil) is the ugliest and oldest of the lot. Then again, Tory is both young and attractive and also morally doubtful, and her actions have resulted in her seeming far less sympathetic. And given D\'Anna was willing even in her last (S4) appearance to wipe out humanity even after they helped resurrect her she probably deserves to be in the morally doubtful region along with Tory.\n The (only) perfectly upstanding character, Karl Agathon, is named after this trope (see "Kalos kai Agathos" above).\n Doctor Who:\n None of the Doctors of Doctor Who were victims of savage beatings with the ugly stick (or at least not for long), but most of them are or were unconventionally handsome. Most subversive is Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor), who was not what you\'d call the most traditionally handsome of men, yet was easily the most popular and well-recognised of the Doctors in the classic series (though that second is partly longevity). The companions, however, are almost invariably traditionally beautiful, with their beauty often being the main indication that the Doctor is going to pick them up.\n The more conventionally handsome Doctors (Fifth, Eighth, Tenth and Eleventh) tend to be the more \'human\' in outlook, with the odder-looking ones tending towards being either more prickly (First, Third, Ninth) or more psychologically alien (Second, Fourth, Seventh). The one glaring exception is Six, who starts out conventionally handsome and a very abrasive, alien Jerkass, and then becomes nicer \u2014 but gains a lot of weight. Note also that being a more human Doctor does not mean that those Doctors are nicer at all - both the Fifth and Tenth seem sweet but are particularly judgmental and ruthless compared to the far more forgiving, but harder to handle socially, Second and Fourth. And note also that the odder-looking ones can still be charming and sexy, notably the Third (a not amazing-looking old man with a really large nose who nevertheless was played as a bit of a sex object).\n The Fourth Doctor even lampshades this trope and his odd appearance when pulling faces at himself in the mirror after his new regeneration - "can\'t say much about the physiognomy". He does, however, remark that his new nose is a big improvement, even though it\'s bigger and more hooked than his last one.\n Played with by the Sixth Doctor, who (at the beginning of his tenure, anyway) is probably the most conventionally attractive of the classic Doctors, and is initially alarmed, then pleased by how good-looking he suddenly is, doing a lot of Showing Off the New Body. Unfortunately, he\'s also a tasteless Insufferable Genius egomaniac and one of the most bastardly of all the Doctors thus far, especially in contrast to his incredibly sweet and human previous self. As he gets nicer, he gains weight, ages and gets worse hair.\n The Eleventh Doctor also plays with this. He has an unusual sort of face that looks extremely handsome from certain angles, and extremely ugly with other ones - Steven Moffat said he looks like "a caricature of a handsome man". The camera crew exploit this, making him look handsome when he\'s being noble and kind, and ugly when he\'s being frightening and weird.\n Really played with when it comes to the Twelfth Doctor, whose actor Peter Capaldi was the second-oldest of the numbered Doctors when cast. He is Creepy Good to the core, Lean and Mean with Big Ol\' Eyebrows and Death Glares, a Pragmatic Hero with No Social Skills who alienates his companion Clara \u2014 she knew Eleven well (and also met Ten and the War Doctor) and knows he needs her still as Twelve, but almost leaves him for good during his first season solely due to his scary, prickly ways. Twelve is also a less boastful man who wants to be more virtuous than his previous selves were, and capable of incredible empathy, compassion, and forgiveness. His look noticeably softens as time passes, and while he is often grumpy and always a dangerous man to cross (the final stretch of Series 9 has him temporarily become a Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds after a Trauma Conga Line drives him mad), he also has a tender, poetic soul. When he encounters his time-hopping wife River Song post-Series 9, he  becomes the "sweetie" she pined for, the lover that Eleven never could bring himself to be, ultimately staying with her for twenty-four years.\n Though there is a subversion \u2014 The Master\'s not a bad-looking guy in most of his incarnations; Delgado and Ainley are both sort of suave older men and Simm is more conventionally attractive. As well, there\'s a deliberate, subversive contrast when it comes to  the female incarnation Missy, played by Michelle Gomez. Missy is an classy middle-aged woman whose mannerisms are cheery and polite; anyone would side with her over the Twelfth Doctor based on first impressions.\n The "monsters" are generally unattractive by human standards, but it\'s often subverted with the revelation that they\'re not really that monstrous. Some of them are capital-E-Evil, but some have Blue and Orange Morality, some of them are Well Intentioned Extremists, and some of them are actually the good guys.\n Played straight in the first Dalek serial, "The Daleks". The two races on Skaro are the Daleks, a Little Green Man in a Can species with Robo Speak voices whose mutated form is never shown aside from the reactions of the people who see it, and the Thals, an Inhumanly Beautiful Race who are all blond-haired and tall. While the Thals initially attempt to give medicine to the crew and the Daleks imprison them out of paranoia, it\'s notable that the Daleks aren\'t really all that bad in their first story, as the viewer is assumed to want to side with the beautiful Thals over them on sight. The Daleks also soon got Flanderized into full-on space-racists with no sympathetic qualities at all. When Doctor Who\'s writing improved and the Thals-versus-Daleks dynamic became the relic, "Genesis of the Daleks" showed the Daleks as the genetically brain-damaged followers of an evil mad scientist, and deconstructed the Thals\' supposed pacifism and their patriarchal, beauty-fetishising culture, showing them mistreating Sarah Jane because of her sex and putting anyone visibly deformed from chemical weapons as a subhuman slave caste.\n Zigzagged in the William Hartnell-era story "The Rescue". The TARDIS lands, Barbara and Ian go out to investigate, and an insect-like, googly-eyed monster, named Coquillion, attacks Barbara. When Ian returns to the Doctor, the Doctor reveals he\'s been on this planet before, and the natives are a very nice species who live in isolated, egalitarian and cooperative social groups of about a hundred and have nothing to gain from becoming violent, and refuses to accept the terrifying appearance Ian claims Coquillion had as evidence he would ever kill anyone. However, the Doctor and Ian get trapped in a cave with a different, lizardlike monster while investigating, and assume it\'s going to eat them. Later, Barbara (who survived) shoots the monster from the cave because she thinks it was attacking an orphaned human girl, but it turns out that it was a herbivorous creature that she treated like a pet. At the end of the story, however, the Doctor corners Coquillion and reveals that what we assumed was his face was actually ceremonial dress used in his people\'s religious rituals, being worn by a human man who claims to have committed genocide against the natives of the planet. The man is then attacked by two natives who survived his genocide, and we see that they are actually beautiful blond men similar to Thals.\n The First Doctor story "Galaxy Four" defies this with the Drahvins and the Rills. The Drahvins are a militaristic, nearly all female race of would-be conquerors who enforce a Fantastic Caste System and are also all blonde and beautiful. The Rills are Starfish Aliens who make it a point to hide their appearance because they\'re perfectly aware other races find them terrifying, but are perfectly willing to help the Drahvins leave the planet they are both stranded on once they get their repairs done. The Drahvin leader, Maaga, cannot help but suspect treachery and spends the serial plotting to steal their ship rather than share it.\n Even so, "Galaxy 4" still partially plays it straight - the first indication that the Chumblies aren\'t as hostile as they appear is that they are super cute, with Vicki remarking on it.\n Combined with a Spoiler Title, this rather ruins "The Robots of Death", a Locked Room Mystery where it becomes impossible for the viewer to not spend all their time waiting for the robots (which are quite beautiful thanks to good production values and an art-deco aesthetic, but are obviously non-human and invoke the Uncanny Valley in universe) to start killing people. Fortunately, the story is a lot more complicated than that.\n The major subplot of the American Gothic episode "Eye of the Beholder" plays with and then toes the line of this trope from the heroic perspective of a minor character. In order to obtain custody of his \'son\' Caleb, Sheriff Buck tries to discredit Dr. Crower as a potential legal guardian by revealing his past difficulties with alcohol. To attest to this, he needs the aid of an orderly at the hospital who worked with Matt before he came to Trinity. When the orderly refuses, Buck sends his wife a magic mirror which swiftly turns her into a tempting seductress. The orderly breaks the mirror... which also horribly disfigures his wife. Freed from the spell, she urges him to refuse Buck\'s deal and stand by his friend Matt instead, and he professes to love her no matter what she looks like. Despite this and the name of the episode, the orderly inexplicably does Buck\'s bidding\u2014and though his testimony is as unbiased as possible, and Buck doesn\'t get his hands on Caleb due to a delicious Bait and Switch Chekhov\'s Gun from earlier in the episode, the sheriff still keeps his end of the deal by rewarding the orderly, restoring his wife\'s beauty so they can leave town in peace and good conscience.\n This trope itself is parodied in the Baywatch parody Son Of The Beach, a high-school girl commits a string of murders because she\'s ugly and jealous of pretty girls; however the day is saved when the hero tells her to "take off your glasses," and "now, untie your hair!" and she is revealed that she was really Beautiful All Along.\n Played straight in the American version of The Office: you can roughly approximate how much of a Butt Monkey each character is by how young and attractive they are, with Pam and Jim being the only characters who are not played up as buffoons, get tons of screen time, and end up being shipped together.\n Most modern sitcoms heavily employ this trope. A typical theme will be how the hip, fashionable, sexy-looking wife with the looks of a supermodel is automatically smarter and more competent than her average-looking (or even ugly) husband.\n Averted and called out by one episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, where a creature so horribly ugly it drove you insane turned out to be the good guy. Played straight the rest of the time: Klingons are all rough and rugged, evil Spock has a beard, every girl Kirk falls in love with is horribly attractive, etc.\n This is especially evident in the TNG Klingons. The evil or unpleasant ones, such as the Duras sisters, are hideous, while Worf is much more attractive. This might, however, have something to do with the fact that his adoptive parents introduced him to the wonderful human invention known as a comb.\n Played with in the TV movie America\'s Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story. Two female mourners outside of the home of John and Carolyn include a beautiful brunette and an unattractive redhead. While both women are Gossipy Hens who don\'t like John\'s wife (for obvious reasons), the brunette at least expresses genuine sympathy for Carolyn\'s mother over the tragedy.\nAn episode of the Disney Channel children\'s sit-com "That\'s so Raven" has Cory hire a girl to sing at an event because she\'s attractive even though she can\'t sing a single note. When the camera shows his perspective, we see that he\'s practically hypnotized by her beauty and he imagines her literally singing like an angel by the seaside with the wind blowing through her hair. He realizes how terrible her singing really is after his friends show him a recording of her voice when she\'s not there in person. At the end of the episode he ends up having a talented but mediocre-looking girl sing backstage while she lip syncs in the front.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n Averted in "Secret Agent Man."\nBeware of pretty faces that you find A pretty face can hide an evil mind\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Myths & Religion \xa0\n The assertion that \'beautiful is better\' is very prominent in Greek/Roman Mythology. Most gods and goddesses are described as possessing a beauty so transcendently beautiful that they can\'t even be looked upon with mortal eyes. Hephaeustus \u2014 god of blacksmiths, craftsmen and artisans \u2014 was said to have been thrown from Mt. Olympus because his mother, Hera, was ashamed of having an ugly child. Most of Zeus\x92s and Apollo\x92s philandering was often caused by them falling head over heels at the first attractive person that they saw. In fact, the famous Trojan War was set off both because Paris thought that having the most beautiful woman from the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, was a better option than being freakin\' king of half of the world or genius of warfare offered by Hera and Athena. In the Classical view, beauty isn\'t just in the eye of the beholder, it\'s an objective reality that even divinity doesn\'t ignore.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Professional Wrestling \xa0\n All Japan Womens Pro Wrestling had a tradition of having larger, less attractive wrestlers as Heels (e.g. Dump Matsumoto, Bull Nakano, Aja Kong), and pitting them against smaller, cuter Face wrestlers.(however, all three examples either went through heel face turns or became faces by default at some point, while the cutest most popular baby faces, the Crush Gals, were forced into retirement and ended up returning as resentful heels using the same tactics employed by their old enemies)\n Maybe a bit subverted with TNA Wrestling\'s Knockouts division; everyone is pretty (in some way), regardless of whether they are good or bad. Even Awesome Kong, the big bad black Japanese wrestler, became a babyface and fan favorite.\n Kelly Kelly is one of the few WWE Divas to never undergo a Face\x96Heel Turn, or to have been a heel in the first place. This was probably because she was one of the prettiest Divas ever, and (it was assumed) no one would have ever believed her as a heel. Word Of God is Kelly was going to undergo a Face Heel Turn in 2011, as it would be revealed she was secretly working with Kharma. This would have led to Kelly becoming Divas Champion, with Kharma acting as her muscle (similar to when Sable had Nicole Bass in 1999). After Kharma got pregnant in real life, WWE kept Kelly face and went forward with her becoming Divas Champion, but the majority of fans never bought that she was really that good in the ring.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tabletop Games \xa0\n The goddess Sune of the Forgotten Realms seems to wholeheartedly buy into this trope. Supposedly the goddess of love, she\'s also the goddess of beauty, and earlier editions had game mechanic rules stating that her clergy had to satisfy a minimum level of physical attractiveness (as measured by the charisma stat) in order to serve. Apparently Sune thinks that only beautiful people deserve love, even though Word of God is that she\'s Chaotic Good.\n To the contrary \u2014 Sune\'s dogma is to promote beauty and love even among the ugly. The vanity and prejudice is chiefly the result of her clergy\'s collective vanity refusing to train clerics who were unattractive; a cleric could independently venerate Sune and receive clerical abilities even if he/she had low charisma. He/she just wouldn\'t find a welcome in the church.\n The Hero System games, most notably Champions, postulate that the average man on the street has stats of 8 in all categories, including physical appearance. Player Character on the other hand get a 10 in each category, because they are the heroes. So your "average hero" is notably better looking than a regular schmoe. The stat that reflects your good looks is also by far the easiest one to buy up, so most heroes end up having supermodel good looks because there is very little downside to it.\n Dungeons & Dragons\' Fourth Edition removed or uglied up every attractive monster in the game. (Dryads? Now look like small Treants with breasts. Yes, trees with breasts. Nymphs? Added in Monster Manual 3.)\n More Dungeons & Dragons: Orcs, goblins, trolls, ogres, and other "savage" humanoids are bestial in appearance and almost always portrayed as always evil in official game material and most campaigns. Of course, individual DMs may portray them however they want, and there\'s nothing stopping you from running a game with a tribe of noble, heroic orcs.\n Taken Up to Eleven in Magic: The Gathering by the elves of Lorwyn. Beauty determines status in their society, with the most beautiful known as "perfects". They also hunt down and kill anyone they consider too ugly to live. And then there\'s her, an assassin whose goal is apparently to cut your face, because that\'s as bad as killing you.\n In Rocketmen the good guys are the Rebels who are allied with Mercury, and Venus who both have a matriarchal society some pretty female characters, while the bad guys the Legion of Terra are allied with Mars who are a race of green skin space gorillas.\n In Torg one of the invading realms is a D&D inspired fantasy setting where one of the laws of the universe was that being Honorable increased your beauty while being Corrupt caused you to become uglier. This caused an unfortunate social stigma to attach to just being ugly from birth.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theatre\xa0\n Older Than Steam: William Shakespeare\'s Richard III. While the real Richard may have had a slightly deformed spine and was noted for ruthlessness against political foes, though this was hardly uncommon at the time, everyone remembers Richard from Shakespeare\'s play, a hunchbacked, deformed villain who commits numerous brutal murders during the play, leading up to the time when the attractive and competent and morally pure Henry Tudor can finally deliver Karmic Justice to Richard at Bosworth Field. It is worth noting that not all of this was potentially Shakespeare\'s own idea \u2014 the regime in power at the time were the direct descendants (as in the granddaughter of) Henry Tudor, and wouldn\'t have been too chuffed at seeing anything that even remotely painted Richard III or the rest of the House of York in a good light.\n Some of this is averted in the film starring Sir Ian McKellen, in that Richard looks fairly attractive to those who don\'t realize his looks are based on British Fascist Party leader Oswald Mosley... then again, to a few, it probably makes the character more attractive...\n William Shakespeare\'s Macbeth does not so much subvert it as play with it: Goodness equals Beauty but not vice versa.\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell;  Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,  Yet grace must still look so.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Toys \xa0\n A lot of LEGO themes are like this, with Agents probably being the worst offender in that the vast majority of the villains are disfigured, cyborgs, or both. The Adventurers\' Baron von Baron/Sam Sinister is a stereotypical Nazi officer with a monocle, handlebar mustache, Dueling Scar, and hookhand, while the only other Adventurers villain who could be considered attractive in the conventional sense is Alexis Sanister. Ogel, of Alpha Team, has some kind of red glass eye, and of course a hook, while his Mooks are skeletons. The Evil Wizard from the Castle sets has the same face as Ogel, so that\'s another one. The Bulls of Knight\'s Kingdom have are scarred, clad in rusted armour, and have silver eyes. Things get far worse, of course, if you consider the Pirates to be bad guys, what with the hooks, peglegs, eyepatches, and scars. To give LEGO some credit, they have had scarred or deformed heroes, like Rock Raider\'s Chief (prosthetic arm), Power Miner\'s Rex (facial scarring), Dino Attack\'s Viper (more facial scarring), and Lego Island\'s Captain Click (a pirate skeleton). Still, ugly villains greatly outnumber even unattractive (if they were real) heroes.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Video Games \xa0\n Fire Emblem does an almost facepalmingly straight adherence to this rule. Almost all the good guys will be bishonen, ruggedly handsome men, hot chicks, Cool Old Guys (sometimes good looking for their age, too) and most of the bosses will be old\u25ca, plain\u25ca or gonks\u25ca. They\'ll attempt to mix things by always adding one or two gonks\u25ca and a non hottie\u25ca to the good guys side, and typically the bad guys will have one or two good looking guys on their side, however they\'ll usually be either good at heart or wear an unflattering facial expression on their portrait\u25ca. Sometimes a few of the ugly minor bosses will hint or be revealed to not have been bad at heart after their death. The simplest way to put it is ugly characters are the Token Minority for the good guys and attractive characters are the Token Minority for the bad guys. Ugly good guys far outnumber attractive bad guys, seems Evil Is Sexy is not one of Intelligent Systems\' favorite tropes... for males. When it comes to females, evil\u25ca is\u25ca sexy\u25ca too\u25ca. This can sometimes make sense (Most of the early foes are low class bandits, the latter ones are old nobles are in some games a separate species, while most player characters are nobility or young), but often doesn\'t.\n If you\'re a sympathetic character in Fire Emblem, you\'re either at least quite attractive, or you\'re old. And if you fall into the latter category, you were likely quite a looker when you were younger. There are only a few major exceptions to this (i.e. most axe-users).\n An exception to this trope might be: Dorothy from Sealed Sword. However she\'s hardly as ugly as the support conversations make her out to be. She\'s more plain ingame still not ugly though\u25ca.\n A major and famous exception is Oliver, from Fire Emblem Tellius. In Path of Radiance, he\'s a regular boss who has to be disposed of (and there\'s a good chance that an ally character kill him for you), and he\'s an insufferable narcissist, viewing himself as the epitome of beauty... Despite the fact that he looks like this\u25ca. He makes his return in Radiant Dawn where, against all odds, despite being once again the boss of a chapter, he is recruitable. Except that, well, he hasn\'t changed much (if at all) between the two games: he\'s still the same vain, self-absorbed character, who only joins you as a protector of beauty (he\'s quite fond of herons). Though they decided to make him less evil-looking\u25ca, he\'s still the Gonk. Heck, even Ike begs him to return on the enemy side.\n Axe users are most apparent of this. While enemy characters of other classes are usually at least pleasant enough to look at, 90% of enemy axe users are Gonks, made even easier to do because there are no female enemy axe users in the entire series. Axe users on the player\'s side, however, are either ruggedly handsome or even straight up bishonen; at worse, they have a fairly large build, which is generally considered unattractive in Asian cultures.\n Exceptions are major enemy characters who aren\'t old men, because you have to be attractive to be anyone of significance, naturally.\n Interestingly, due to the Capture mechanics of Fire Emblem Fates, while this trend is still in play with a number of villains, this can be subverted with a number of Gonk-ish or not-conventionally attractive villains, who can be convinced to join your side. Of course, since they aren\'t plot important, you can off them anyway.\n Reversed in Two Worlds II: at one point, the protagonist is begged by the helpful leader of a nearly-doomed colony to hunt down the reason of their misery -  an evil witch, who not only lives deep in a swamp, but who is indeed hideous. However, instead of  killing the witch, the protagonist can also listen to her unexpected pleas. Doing so opens an entire new subplot, which eventually reveals that  the real Evil Force was actually the charismatic leader, while the witch was the true protector of the people. The reversal is then reversed in the end of that subplot, as  the witch\'s beauty is magically restored upon the demise of the real villain.\n Played straight in Drakengard. Another layer is added on with the impossibly beautiful and pacifistic elves and the horrific designs for the monsters, who are bloodthirsty and primitive. These other creatures are rarely seen, however. And really, what\'s more beautiful than a baby?\n World of Warcraft generally averts this, although sometimes small bits get through.\n In the Classic, the Alliance had all the pretty races while the Horde had the ugly ones. However, the Horde was not evil, merely Noble Savage in a morally gray fight over the land to live on. Burning Crusade\'\' further muddied the trope by giving them the pretty Blood Elves.\n A little shade of it was in the Draenei and their changes over the years. Originally, they were an ugly race with More Teeth than the Osmond Family and raptorish feet, which nevertheless were allied with the Anti-Hero Illidan and opposed the demonic Eredar (who had typical Horny Devils appearance.) In the Burning Crusade they were retconned to being a fallen and mutated Draenei - and we were introduced to the proper, clean and pretty Draenei as a playable race, directly allied with the Naaru. The previous Draenei, now called Lost Ones, were portrayed almost exclusively as insane villains. The newly introduced Ugly Cute Broken were also made antagonists, but it was due to being enslaved by Illidan gone mad, not being inherently evil. Furthermore, the trope was averted with the Eredar, who were shown to be Draenei that fully embraced the demon powers - they look just like Draenei, only red instead of blue.\n Mists Of Pandaria plays this straight due to applying Sudden Sequel Heel Syndrome on practically the entire Horde, particularly the orcs, while getting downplaying all morally grey qualities of the Alliance. Additionally Garrosh was given a much uglier model before becoming a Raid Boss.\n The only nice demon bound in Jerro\'s Haven in Neverwinter Nights 2 is also the one who goes around disguised as an Eladrin.\n In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, if the player character goes to The Dark Side, s/he develops pale whitish skin and yellowed eyes. In the sequel, the player character can influence his or her allies to go Dark, causing a number of changes in their appearances (none of them good).\n In Mass Effect 1, Saren, the apparent Big Bad of the game, is clearly weird-looking by Turian standards, sporting glowing blue eyes and cybernetic implants on top of the spikey Turian exoskeleton. On the other hand, Benezia is much more attractive but still acts as Saren\'s Dragon for much of the game. However,  it\'s revealed that both of them have been brainwashed by Soverign, and both of them get a Dying as Yourself ending (optional in Saren\'s case). Soverign himself is a giant insectoid spaceship and makes use of Blue and Orange Morality behavior.\n In the second game, quite a few of the villains are even more monstrous: the Collectors, for example, are Insectoid Aliens equipped with a lot of repulsive-looking organic technology, and serve the Reapers in abducting human colonists for use in their experiments.  Once again, it\'s revealed that the Collectors are just brainwashed servants of the Reapers; before they were enslaved, the Collectors were the equally bizarre-looking Protheans, Benevolent Precursors to the current galactic civilization.\n In Mass Effect 2, picking the Renegade choices will make Commander Shepard\'s post-resurrection scars appear wider and glow red (a rather disturbing picture here). It can be subverted, however, through a plastic surgery later in the game. On the other hand, Paragon choices will make the scars shrink so much, said surgery will hardly be worth the resources it costs.\n Persona 4 - Hanako, Mitsuo, Morooka, and Kashiwagi (who isn\'t specifically ugly, but has a tendency toward drastic, overly-exaggerated and unattractive expressions, and a crap personality), have no particular positive qualities and the heroes have no sympathy for them. The exceptions are  Adachi, who the player is supposed to trust, and Izanami, whose true form is legendarily hideous but appears as an attractive lady.\n Used in Final Fantasy VII spinoff: Dirge of Cerberus. Deranged scientist Hojo still looks to be in his late middle age, as a young man.\n Darkstalkers has Felicia. Who\'s the nicest out of a cast of anti-heroes and is gorgeous.\n Played straight and averted in Yo-Jin-Bo. Just about everyone except Yahei (nice old man) and Nobumasa (big, dumb, and evil) could be considered at least above-average. Of course all six Love Interests are extremely attractive, but villains Kasumimaru and Harumoto aren\'t bad looking, either.\n Played straight in Valkyria Chronicles. All the villains have exaggerated, ostentatious, or just plain ugly faces, unless the game presents a reason for the player to sympathize with their tragic plight, while everyone in Squad 7 ranges from plain to rugged to just plain gorgeous. (The bad guys do, however, wear some truly awesome-looking officers\' uniforms).\n Both Gabriel and Marie Belmont from Castlevania: Lords of Shadow fit this. Marie\'s natural pure heart is what makes Gabriel so attracted to her all his life even after her tragic death; her sweet laugh was often enough to soothe his chronic moodiness. As of Gabriel, in spite of his unshaven facial hair, is still dignified due to his natural sense of justice and kindness. Had Hideo Kojima allowed him to be a Barbarian Hero, this would be even more obvious.\n In the Fable series of games, it goes beyond good characters being beautiful; if you do good things, your character becomes more beautiful, to the point of people on the street commenting on it constantly. (Doing bad things makes your character grow horns and become wrinkled.)\n The Shadow Sirens from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door are as "good" as their appearance: Vivian is cute and pulls a full Heel\x96Face Turn, Marilyn lands in the middle and is neutral (though loyal to the baddies), and Beldam is ugly and fully evil.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Web Video\xa0\n Demo Reel. The heroes are all conventionally gorgeous - Donnie is wanted by everyone, Tacoma consistently is told he looks good in a dress, Rebecca is played by a model, Quinn spends most of his time in a wifebeater and Karl has a foursome with con-girls - while the villains (the Psychopathic Manchild family and Tom Collins) are either weightier or just made to look awkward.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Web Comics\xa0\n This guy. One guess whether he\'s good or evil.\n Korean webcomic Noblesse. For a "shounen" series, it certainly emphasizes a lot on androgynous male beauty. & you can bet every attractive bad guy you see will be working for the protagonist by the end of the arc.\n For most of the first volume of Quantum Vibe, when Nicole and Seamus have an antagonistic relationship, and the audience is expected to be somewhat suspicious of him, a regeneration error has trapped him in a 250 kg body with a dumpy face and kinky red hair. It\'s about the time she begins to trust him implicitly that this is fixed, leaving him thin and beautiful with perfect face and hair.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Western Animation \xa0\n Bramble, the villain of the Bitsy Bears pilot is relatively unattractive, with a dry bob haircut, but the instant she thinks about reforming, she suddenly becomes more attractive with long, wavy hair. (Seriously, it changes between frames. You can see it starting at 3:45)\n Played with in Earthworm Jim. Princess Whats-Her-Name is a gorgeous human looking woman with bee wings who seeks to free her people from the tyranical rule of her sister, An ugly monster with a giant pus-filled slug for a back side....except by the standards of her species, The queen is the beautiful one while the princess is hideously malformed.\n The eponymous heroes of Gargoyles are superficially ugly monsters (especially Brooklyn), which barely hides their heroic natures. Some fans of the show find them rather cute.\n Goliath - if you can get past the wings, fangs, and talons - could be seen as downright handsome. And let\'s face it, any man with Keith David\'s voice is going to have less trouble with the ladies than he might otherwise.\n Brooklyn - if drawn in the right way and angle - gets points for his exotic nature as a Petting Zooperson.\n And most of the females? Not really ugly at all (although the one we see the most is not all that good either).\n Goof Troop uses this in an interesting way for just one family. Everyone\'s favorite Fat Bastard, Pete, has a son, PJ, who is physically his spitting image in terms of body composition, hair color and form, and ear shape. He\'s also significantly nicer. Pete\'s face is fairly ugly; PJ\'s is downright cute. At the very least, he\'s the male character on the show with the smallest protruding teeth, and often doesn\'t have protruding teeth at all.\n On Justice League (and Justice League Unlimited), only two of the big seven are even remotely not conventionally attractive. J\'onn, while green, is a shapeshifter who can look however he wants, and Hawkgirl\'s "weird" look is angelic wings. Now, let\'s take a look at the villains: Gorilla Grodd, Ultra-Humanite, Parasite, Shade, the White Martians... Except the female ones. And Luthor. Bodies are likewise ridiculously one-note exaggerations, with Top-Heavy Guy being the norm\u2014 and not just in body, but with chins that would make Jay Leno blush. Not surprising, given that they\'re based on comicbook characters (easily the worst offender anywhere). Ultra-Humanite happens to also be a subversion in the comics as his power is stealing bodies and he did once steal the body of a beautiful woman.\n In My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Rarity (she\'s as beautiful as she is generous) and Fluttershy (she\'s as beautiful as she is kind). Also Princess Celestia although she is more a Hot Goddess. She is drawn more aesthetically... more clean, shiny, "beautiful", and pretty... compared to the rest of the cast. It\'s implied that she is (or fits) the ideal for equine beauty in Equestria; for example, the beauty parlor in Ponyville has a picture of a pony with her tall and slender proportions.\n Teen Titans. The Titans themselves do fight ugly villains or even twisted looking monsters. Inverted with Jinx, Blackfire, Madame Rouge...\n Fusions in Steven Universe sometimes have extra features from being composed of two people, but how neatly they come together seems indicative of the health of the relationship. Stable, heroic fusions like Opal and Garnet have relatively few extra features that mesh harmoniously with the rest of their appearance, while Sugilite, a destructive and potentially dangerous fusion, is more beastly in form, boasting five eyes, pronounced fangs, and two sets of arms that blend at the shoulder. Alexandrite, while more \'balanced\' than Sugilite, is still a bizarre-looking mess, which makes sense as she\'s all three Crystal Gems trying to act as one.\n The antagonistic fusion Malachite is barely even humanoid, with a second torso where her hips should be, two independently-operating sets of eyes, and four extra arms that serve as legs. Her components are using each other for selfish gain- Jasper is just using Lapis for the power boost, and Lapis is using the fusion to take control of and imprison Jasper.\n In Chowder no one is attractive and practically everyone is either some kind of a weird creature or a weird-looking humanoid, but Chef Mung Daal\'s main rival is a monstrous woman called Ms. Endive, although in one episode it\'s revealed that she\'s bitter and advises her apprentice Panini to stay away from boys only because Mun Daal once left her at the wedding altar.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Real Life\xa0\n The Halo effect is a documented psychological phenomenon wherein people\'s judgment on another person\'s traits spills over to other (unrelated) traits. So the perception is that beautiful = good/competent, ugly = bad/incompetent, etc. Further proof (as if further proof were needed) that life is indeed unfair. To go even further, in social psychology there exists such a thing as "self-fulfilling prophecy" which further cements the "halo effect". Those who are treated as good or bad people (even if only on the basis of their appearance) will be prone to behave accordingly. That is, those who are treated good, will behave good in return and vice versa.\n The 1960 U.S. presidential election debates were the first to be televised. Polls showed that those who watched the debate on television thought the handsome John F. Kennedy had won the debate, while those who listened on the radio thought the sweaty, uncomfortable looking Richard Nixon had won. Of course, TV being a relatively emergent technology that was only just starting to be adapted at the time could have resulted in differences in the demographics of television owners and non-television owners. And, of course, while it might be a poor reason to not vote for someone because they look like a slightly-crazed, paranoid, crook, the fact that Nixon in fact turned out to be a slightly-crazed, paranoid, crook is of no little relevance.\n Even more interesting: While Kennedy was the president who brought the US military into The Vietnam War full-force (before then, we were supplying troops but it was not an official war), the less-attractive Lyndon Johnson has tended to receive the lion\'s share of the blame for the conflict. Nixon was the one who eventually pulled us out, but this is rarely mentioned, mainly due to (a) his "tough talk" rhetoric that made this seem unlikely (even though it was actually key to executing the policy at all), (b) his initial escalation of the fighting, and (c) did we mention that this was Richard Nixon?\n Although here a number of other factors are at least as important, if not more so. John F. Kennedy\'s image was retroactively enhanced by his assassination, which conveyed a kind of secular sainthood on him and made a lot of people forget how controversial he had been in life, and also by the fact that there weren\'t many news stories involving Vietnam during his administration. Johnson, in contrast, had to deal with bad news from Vietnam throughout his two terms. And while Nixon got the US Army out of Vietnam, the way that happened was perceived as a humiliating defeat, with e. g. the images of the hurried evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Saigon sticking in the public conscious for decades to come.\n During the Victorian era, this concept was widely held to be true; a person\'s physical appearance was a reflection on their morality and social standing. The introduction discusses 19th Century quackery discourses of Phrenology and Physiognomy as an attempt to quantify and qualify these dubious claims. While the latter discipline was not unique to the 19th Century, its influence and popularity reached a zenith during the Georgian, Regency, and especially, Victorian eras. This wasn\'t surprising, since one\'s wealth typically coincided with the degree of their access to proper necessities which made beauty even possible; as a result, today\'s "average" was yesterday\'s "god-like."\n In Spanish, "to be" can be translated as two different verbs (ser and estar) "ser buena" (to be good) means to be a good/nice person, and "estar buena" (literally translated also: "to be good") means being physically attractive (although usually "hot" more than "beautiful"). This might be because ser means "to be a certain way inherently" whereas estar draws its distinction in definition from meaning something more like "to be a certain way at a specific time." In other words, "ser buena" most means "to be good inherently," whereas the most literal translation for "estar buena" could be "to be good for the moment" and not necessarily as a regular thing. This suggests that Spanish-speaking cultures are probably at least somewhat aware of beauty\'s tendency to be fleeting and superficial, and have therefore linked it to temporary and superficial goodness in their language. The connection\u2014however tenuous\u2014between being physically attractive and being morally upright is still there, however.\n That whole mess can technically be avoided with other adjectives (bonito/a, hermoso/a, guapo/a, etc.). In these cases one can say, for example, ser bonita (to be naturally pretty) or estar bonita (to be pretty at the moment, by dressing up for example).\n The ancient Greeks took this very, very seriously. Kaloi k\'agathoi ("the Beautiful and the Good") was what Greek aristocrats called themselves. To be beautiful was considered a gift from the gods and was a sign of their favor. This allowed good-looking Greeks to get away with things just because they were beautiful, and occasionally hurt ugly people when accused of a crime. For instance:\n Phryne, an Athenian courtesan known for her beauty, was once accused of a form of blasphemy. At trial, her defense consisted, at least in part, of stripping off her clothes and saying to the (all-male) jury: "Would you dare destroy this?" She was acquitted\u2014which, to be fair, wasn\'t purely lust on the part of the jury; again, exceptional beauty was seen as a sign of divine favour, so at least some of the jurors may have feared that by executing the exceedingly beautiful Phryne, they would risk the wrath of the gods, or at least figured that one so favoured by the gods was incapable of committing blasphemy. The Athenians have later passed a law that from now on, judges are not to look at the defendants.\n Socrates, on the other hand, was famously ugly (both Aristophanes and Plato make quite a few "ugly guy" jokes at Socrates\' expense). This may have figured into the decision to convict Socrates at trial (the decision to execute him, on the other hand, was more or less because of what he said).\n Public opinion in any trial by media scenario will often fall in line with this trope. Missing White Woman Syndrome (always pretty, young girls) is an obvious real-life relation, and people often have harsher reactions to unusual looking suspects (as opposed to attractive serial killers mentioned below, who often get fanmail or marriage proposals). Even non-criminal media scandals get this reaction. Take, for example, public perception of the British Royal Family. Princess Diana is lovingly remembered, despite having affairs as her former husband did, while Prince Charles is unpopular and Lady Camilla is largely hated, and both are mocked for their appearance.\n According to an actual scientific subject on the topic, beautiful criminals usually get more lenient sentences then their ugly counterparts, regardless of the severity of their crime, but when the crime in question is fraud, the tables are turned: attractive frauds almost consistently get the longest convictions. Psychologists believe that this is due to the fact that people find themselves betrayed when this trope isn\'t played straight, and react far more severely. A beautiful thief or murderer can be explained as a victim of the circumstances, but a beautiful fraud explicitly uses their appearance to deceive and mislead people, and they just can\'t forgive that.\n William Howard Taft was the last president elected before photographs became a standard feature of newspapers (somewhat obviously).\n The opposite assumption\u2014Ugliness Equals Evil\u2014is exhibited in the various meanings of the Arabic word qab\u012b\u1e25. Its most common meaning is simply "ugly," but it can also mean "disgusting" or "monstrous" or, well, "evil" (as an adjective). However, the more usual word for "evil" is shirr\u012br, and the other meanings of qab\u012b\u1e25 only occur to the educated, so it\'s not played entirely straight (except in the Maghreb, where it is the colloquial word for "bad"\u2014not "evil," but "bad"note\xa0i.e., in Morocco, if the thing you bought at the store turned out to be bad, it was qab\u012b\u1e25.).\n This could be one of the principles behind Double Standard: Rape, Female on Male, since the cultural standard for "female" is "beautiful." You can see this in action when it comes to things like child molestation and statutory rape. Mary Kay Letourneau does her 12-year-old student? Have you seen what Mary Kay Letourneau looks like? Either he must have wanted it, or he was gay.\n Recent pictures of Nancy Kerrigan\u25ca and Tonya Harding\u25ca seem to play this trait pretty straight. Kerrigan still looks youthful and gorgeous, while Harding (who, as anyone who was alive during the 1990s remembers, conspired with her ex-husband and bodyguard to break her rival Kerrigan\'s leg to render her incapable of competing in the Olympics), looks a bit like the mother from The Fighter after a few more years\' hard living.\n The cast of the Harry Potter films - at least with the kids - plays it somewhat straight. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Tom Felton (Draco), who have never gotten into legal trouble and have good public images, are all thin and lauded for their looks. Jamie Waylett (Crabbe), who was arrested for drug possession and sentenced to a two-year prison sentence, looks like this\u25ca. Quite a contrast, eh?\n Many Christian denominations believe human souls will be reunited with their bodies on Judgment Day, and their bodies will be transformed. The righteous will receive beautiful, glorified bodies that resemble extremely idealized versions of themselves, while the wicked will be placed in twisted, pain wracked versions of their old bodies.\n Unfortunately, it\'s for this reason that animals people consider cute or charismatic get better protection than creepier or menacing looking ones. It\'s the reason What Measure Is a Non-Cute? exists.\nWhen shown a picture of an attractive person and an unattractive person and given no other information, people tend to ascribe more positive qualities to the attractive person along with a few negative ones such as vanity.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Other \xa0\n Fairytales and folklore are chock-full of this so much that in many cases \'ugly\' is shorthand for \'completely deficient as a human being in every conceivable way possible.\'\n But be wary. The Shape Shifting Lover, if male, may be hideous before the change, and a hideous old woman may be enchanted and truly young and beautiful.\n Other than the odd tchotchke made to cater to ethnic appeal, angels are always shown with flowing blonde hair, beatific bordering on vacant smiles, rosy to pure white skin and sparkling azure eyes. Never will you see one with pock marked skin, a big nose or even mouse brown hair. This interpretation is so common there\'s a trope for it. Made even more ridiculous since angels in The Bible look like the stuff of nightmares.\n\nSubversions and played-with examples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Anime and Manga \xa0\n Gilgamesh of Fate/stay night is a fair-skinned, red-eyed, golden armor-wearing spiky haired blond Bish\u014dnen who happens to be an A-rank douchebag and firmly rooted in the villain camp. He is given plenty of depth however, and though he is evil he has a clear set of morals.\n Played around with quite a bit in Death Note, in just about every permutation:\n Villain Protagonist Light Yagami is popular, impeccably groomed and dressed, has girls fawning over him everywhere. He seems good at first, but turns into the worst serial killer in history and a Magnificent Bastard who manipulates everyone around him with no consideration for their feelings.\n However,  this is played straight with Light when he loses his memories of the Death Note for a brief period of time. He is a really great guy, the complete opposite of Kira, and he is still gorgeous.\n In contrast, L, the detective chasing Kira, is gangly, funny-looking, and has permanent bags under his eyes; most girls in-story won\'t even look at him twice, and he has no friends. But he\'s the world\'s greatest detective, with a strong determination to take down the murderer, albeit using somewhat questionable methods. He\'s often considered Ugly Cute, granted, but this was unintentional.\n Misa Amane is a supermodel who turns into a serial killer, though she thinks she\'s doing it for a good reason; she\'s genuinely kind and friendly aside from her actions as the second Kira.\n Ryuk, the Shinigami, plays this trope relatively straight: he looks like a monster, and he\'s a nut who doesn\'t care who lives or dies as long as he\'s entertained, and he uses humans as playthings. He\'d be another Magnificent Bastard if he weren\'t so lazy.\n Shinigami Rem still looks somewhat scary, but she\'s softer and more feminine than Ryuk, and she does what she does out of a sense of duty to a fallen friend, along with genuine compassion for Misa which leads to a Heroic Sacrifice.\n Then there\'s Sidoh, who\'s ugly as normal for a Shinigami, but isn\'t so much evil as pathetic and pitifully stupid.\n Virtually all of the common criminals are butt-ugly. I guess breaking the law only makes you ugly if you do it without the help of a Shinigami.\n Then there\'s Mello and Near, where this trope is REALLY played around with. On the one hand, Near is like L in that he is an anti-heroic antagonist who uses questionable methods, yet he looks like a cute little boy. Meanwhile, Mello is an extreme Byronic Hero who commits some pretty appalling crimes just so he can beat Near in catching Kira, yet he is a pretty handsome guy to start with. His face gets scarred later on, but even then he is arguably still pretty attractive.\n The psychopathic Johan is easily Monster\'s best-looking character.\n Naoki Urasawa puts about as much stock in this trope as Pratchett does (read: none). This guy here\u25ca is the hero of 20th Century Boys (whose Ragtag team of freedom fighters includes, among others, an old homeless man and a guy best described as a human frog). The sinister-looking guy here with the receding hairline\u25ca is one of the good guys in Pluto. This little cutie? Satan incarnate.\n Averted in Paprika. The obese Tokita appears to have no deep and dark issues with his weight, being a happy, brilliant, affable scientist, and it turns out the girl of his dreams, Chiba, is plenty enthralled with him as well, and they get married!\n Commonly subverted or played with in One Piece. Ugly characters often turn out to be stalwart and good in their own right, and more conventionally attractive characters can be really, really awful or kind of ambiguous at best.\n Unless they\'re women. Nine times out of ten, attractive women are good (Nami, Vivi, Robin, Hancock) while ugly women are evil (Alvida pre-transformation, Miss Merry Christmas, Big Mom). There is the occasional subversion, though, where an attractive woman can be evil (Miss Doublefinger, Kalifa, Monet) and an ugly woman is good (Kokoro, Lola).\n Kintano from Angel Densetsu is the Nice Guy, The Pollyanna, All-Loving Hero, and an Actual Pacifist. His face, however, makes small children cry.\n Beauty may equal goodness, but on one show in particular, "Beauty" equals...exasperation (constantly).\n Yu-Gi-Oh! toys with it in the person of Marik Ishtar. He\'s a Bish\u014dnen in a Bare Your Midriff outfit who has all the fangirls fawning over him. He\'s also a Manipulative Bastard who plots to Take Over the World via Mind Rape. He\'s later revealed to have a Superpowered Evil Side with Omnicidal Maniac and Combat Sadomasochist tendencies; this identity (Dark Marik), is also far, far, uglier with grotesque facial features, Anime Hair, bulging eyes, Tainted Veins, and a much more brutal, muscular build. So beauty equals evil, but ugly equals more evil?\n Trinity Blood subverts this beautifully. Deitrich is described as having "the face of an angel and the heart of a devil". Despite his beautiful appearance he\'s evil. In addition, during the final battle in the anime Cain\'s ultimate form resembles a heavenly angel, while Abel\'s ultimate form resembles a demon from hell\n Interesting case in Mobile Suit Victory Gundam. Katejima Loos is portrayed as a beautiful girl in her late teens. The series protagonist, Uso, certainly thinks so, since he has a crush on her.  She starts out as one of the main heroic cast, but slowly shows her true colors of being a Manipulative Bitch. Even when it\'s clear that she\'s far from good, Uso refuses to believe that she\'s evil, even when she tries to kill him on multiple occasions. This changes near the end of the series, when he finally wakes up and fights her back. She even points this out, afterwards, acting shocked that her charms no longer work.\n The main character\'s best friend in the light novel of Ghost Hunt gets hit hard with this trope. Shibuya Kazuya is stunningly beautiful, even after a rough night with next to no sleep at all. Naturally Mai and her two best friends form instant crushes ... until Mai realises that he\'s abrasive, cocky, sarcastic, narcissistic and flat-out insulting to just about everyone. What\'s Michiru\'s response when she\'s informed of this? "But ... he\'s really handsome." Because someone that pretty cannot possibly be a bad person ... Further subverted in that he genuinely does care for his colleagues and clients, and always acts only in the interest of their safety - he just doesn\'t like to show it.\n In Anatolia Story, most of the noble characters are portrayed as very beautiful. They\'re generally divided between being Royals Who Actually Do Something (for example, Kail and his brothers) and those who are incompetent or outright harmful to the wellbeing of their countries (for example, Nakia and  Nefertiti). The very hansome Ramses wants to gain power in Egypt so he can better care for its people which is a noble goal, but he also repeatedly tries to kidnap and rape Yuri, leading her to consider him a complete cad. Meanwhile, Nakia and Urhi are very beautiful, but also are incredibly and unbelievably evil. Even worse, their backstories show that their beauty caused the circumstances that lead to them becoming as horrible as they are. Yuri, meanwhile, is very cute by modern day standards, but is initially considered plain by most people in Hattusa, mainly because she\'s short and flat-chested. As people begin to love her for her kindness and the good things she does for them, they talk about features that they do consider beautiful about her (namely her pale skin and black hair) and her maids imply that her beauty comes from her happy, friendly demeanor.\n Played with in Magi \x96 Labyrinth of Magic. For most part, the heroes or ambiguous anti-heroes are mostly good-looking. But certain villains like Jamil, Judar and  Gyokuen Ren and other Al-Thamen members like Dunya and Ithan are just as attractive, though they can occasionally lapse into twisted, dark caricatures.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Art\xa0\n In Byzantine Christian art, most Saints are drawn somewhat ugly to accentuate their Inner Beauty represented by their halo.\n Many Renaissance portrayals of Saints or Biblical characters were intentionally drawn plain as to avoid inspiring lust for a holy character. However, angels, who were genderless...\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Comic Books \xa0\n Ben "The Thing" Grimm is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Universe, despite, or perhaps because, he\'s a massive rock creature.\n Beta Ray Bill. He looks like an orange humanoid crocodile/horse hybrid, and is even considered hideous by his own peoples\' standards (they normally just look like yellow humanoids with no hair or pupils), yet he is one of the noblest beings in the Marvel Universe. One of the most badass, too. After all, he was the first non-Asgardian to be deemed worthy enough to wield The Mighty Thor\'s hammer, Mjolnir, which was of course intended to be a shock to both Thor and readers.\n The Anti-Hero mutant Wolverine\u2014longstanding, undisputed favorite of the X-Men franchise\u2014was originally supposed to be a subversion. Five-foot-nothing, slightly hunched, enough hair on his body to wonder why he didn\'t wind up with the "Beast" codename, and reportedly, poor personal hygiene (even though you know as well as I do he couldn\'t maintain hair like that without being half-metrosexual). However, because of Popularity Power, many writers sometimes forget the above description and turn him into a sexy funtastic lady-lovin\' machine. Maybe it\'s animal magnetism, or his fan-favoritism (the current writers were fans in their youth), or they realize that one word has always defined Wolvie: stamina. Even at his ugliest, he looks pretty good for 113!\n Spider-Girl, in her identity as May Parker, started out as a star basketball player with short hair, a major subversion from just about all the mainstream superheroines who\'ve ever gotten their own series. Since that time, while May has grown her hair a little longer, what little Fanservice exists is rather mild, if not non-existent, compared to what many readers have come to expect.\n Hellboy was started when the creator, Mike Mignola, wanted a hero that looked like a villain. Hence, Hellboy looks like a demon.\n Fables has the actual Prince Charming as a major character and also shallow, heartless, bastard. Goldilocks is very attractive and turns out to be murderously violent. Bluebeard is well Bluebeard. Beauty is beautiful but happens to be a total bitch. Bibgy\'s looks are up for debate but his actions support him being a subversion whether you thing he\'s good looking or not.\n Of course, played with often in Watchmen, thanks to the series blurring the lines between ugliness and beauty, and heroism and villainy.\n Rorschach, despite being one of the main heroes (and most certainly is the star of the book), is ugly as sin. Uneven haircut (and ginger at that), short, pug nose, spotty face, dead eyes, aged face, he\'s described as being "fascinatingly ugly" by his psychiatrist. Hasn\'t stopped a small portion of the female fanbase being into him...\n Ozymandias. Tall, muscular, blonde, handsome, older than he looks, strong features.  The "villain" of the series.\n Of course, these two examples could either be considered an aversion or playing it straight, depending on your point of view.\n Played the straightest with Nite Owl II, who is a little hefty and wears thick glasses but is considered very handsome by at least two characters.\n Silk Spectre II is rather stunning, like her Mom, but she doesn\'t care for the hero thing at all.\n Her Mom, Silk Spectre I, was a successful hero because she was a beauty. It was publicity to help her movie career.\n Dr Manhattan rebuilt himself in the shape of the ideal man and the classical hero, standing well over six feet with statuesque features. He even walks around naked. However, he doesn\'t care at all for heroism.\n The Comedian is tall, handsome and has "badboy appeal", which also plays the trope straight except... he\'s not much of a hero. It straightens out again when his scars and age reduce his good looks to a rather leathery looking ball of meat.\n In Sin City, physical beauty in general is not a good barometer for morality in a setting like this, even though some of the heroes do play it very straight.\n Marv is a massive, ugly monster of a man but is also a good man.\n Ava Lord is pure evil but was extremely beautiful to the point where she could easily manipulate almost any man into doing her bidding.\n Junior was also fairly handsome and looked every bit the golden boy future President his father wanted him to become \u2014 too bad about the whole "raping and killing little girls" hobby. It\'s played straight with Junior after the experimental treatments that saved him from Hartigan\'s No-Holds-Barred Beatdown also disfigured him.\n One Two-Face comic subverts this nicely. After he gets the surgery to fix the mangled side of his face his split personality is cured and he no longer needs the coin. Too bad the mangled side of his face represented the good Harvey Dent, and without it he sinks completely into evil and is no longer held back by his good side.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fairy Tales\xa0\n In The Three Spinners, three hideous women offer to help the heroine with her spinning. Unlike Rumpelstiltskin, all they want is to be invited to the wedding. When the heroine does, they assure her husband that their hideous looks stem from their endless spinning and thus get the heroine off the hook forever.\n The Three Aunts is another variant.\n There are countless fairy tales where the protagonist is given vital aid on their quests by dwarves, crones, and sometimes even giant, disembodied heads, such as the King of England\'s Three Sons, where the youngest son meets three ugly brothers along the way.\n In the story of "Tatterhood", the eponymous heroine is filthy and dresses in rags while wearing a goat. Her sister is traditionally beautiful, but is a Damsel in Distress and contributes virtually nothing to the story besides having her head stolen by trolls. The end of the fairy tale does prove that she can be beautiful if she wants, but she makes it clear that she prefers to be ugly.\n There is a fairy tale where a girl is So Beautiful, It\'s a Curse and is harassed by many attractive, wealthy men... one of whom is Satan himself. When she refuses him, the Devil spitefully steals her beauty from her, leaving her ugly and misshapen. Years later, he decides to see what happened to the girl, and is shocked to find that her new ugliness drove away all her unwanted suitors, leaving her Happily Married to an ugly but goodhearted Dogged Nice Guy.\n The Golden Branch subverts this trope and then plays it straight - the protagonists are a prince and a princess who are both very ugly and crippled, but are shown as being good-hearted. The princess is even given the choice between being beautiful and being good, and decides that being good is the better option. Their goodness wins them the favor of a fairy, who eventually rewards them both with beauty. Then, they get turned into animals by an evil witch, and have to get turned back after going on a quest.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Animated\xa0\n Subversion: The Shrek series has an ogre as the hero, and the love of his life becomes an ogress herself at the end of the first film. By contrast, the handsome Prince Charming (from the second and third films) is a bratty, immature, villainous twit.\n There\'s also Charming\'s mother, Fairy Godmother. She\'s got the sweet, matronly look down, and is not above drugging her goddaughter into marrying her son, threatening to essentially ruin King Harold\'s life by turning him back into a frog, and trying to kill Shrek.\n Shrek the Third also has the other princesses, who are shown to be fairly shallow and useless at first, while the ugly stepsister Doris is a lot kinder and stronger. Rapunzel also ends up selling them out so she can marry Charming. She\'s later revealed to be bald which could be playing the trope straight, except that she\'s still an attractive woman, just with no hair.\n Shrek Forever After has all of the ogres as perfectly decent people fighting to overthrow the evil Rumplestiltskin. In that universe, Fiona also identifies as an ogre and keeps her curse of turning into a human woman by day a secret.\n Played with in Megamind. Metroman, the unambiguous hero  who fakes his death because he\'s tired of the life is all Heroic Build and Lantern Jaw of Justice, but then you have Megamind  the villain who becomes good and Titan  who turns bad because he can\'t get the girl. Megamind is a blue alien with giant head, but has huge, puppy-like, instantly endearing Green Eyes complete with eyelashes, while Titan is human but looks and acts like a thug.\n Disney Animated Canon:\n This was the moral to Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast - the attractive Gaston is actually a terrible person while the Beast is very kind and gentle. Of course, the Beast himself (as well as the Prince he turns back into) could be considered quite attractive themselves, depending on one\'s taste.\n While Tiana and Naveen are plenty attractive in The Princess and the Frog, the animation crew also took great pains to make the sinister Doctor Facilier quite charismatic and attractive as well, to explain how he could lure in unsuspecting victims. And then Ray the Firefly is drawn to resemble an in-bred hillbilly, but is still one of the most insightful and helpful characters.\n Both applied AND subverted in Tangled- the main leads are all handsome or cute (Disney even had its own female employees choose what Flynn should look like) and two of the villains (the Stabbington Brothers) are ugly- however the main villainess is pretty hot (while young) and the Snugly Duckling Pub Thugs, despite their looks turned out to be nice guys. They even lampshade it in one of the movie\'s best musical numbers. It\'s also lampshaded with Flynn\'s Wanted Poster, which portrays his criminal self as uglier than he actually is.\n Subverted in both of Disney\'s Cinderella sequels, where Anastasia is an ugly stepsister but is a nicer person. She\'s a little better drawn arguably, but it\'s more of a result of her not scowling all of the time.\n It\'s easier to list the times Disney averts or subverts this trope than the many, many times it plays it straight. Besides the aforementioned Gaston in Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid and Frozen both have beautiful leads and antagonists who use their beauty to manipulate others \u2014 Vanessa for the former and Prince Hans for the latter.\n Double Subversion in Bartok the Magnificent, where the ugly Russian witch Baba Yaga is actually portrayed as being a benign character, and she even makes a magic potion that can make people on the outside 10 times what they are on the inside. According to Yaga, the titular bat is supposed to drink the potion, which will turn him into a brave hero, but the potion is later stolen by the evil Ludmilla, who is portrayed as being beautiful. Ludmilla actually wants to use Jaga\'s potion to make her even more beautiful so she can take over Russia, but when she finally drinks it, said potion realizes that Ludmilla is evil once consumed, and as a result it turns her into a dragon.\n The villain of Happily N\'Ever After 2 starts out ugly and turns herself beautiful so she can marry the king.\n Strange Magic: The film subverts it early on when the text book prince-level handsome Roland turns out to be a cheating jerk.  It also subverts it with the Bog King, a ugly insect humanoid who turns out to be surprisingly heroic after falling in love. Roland turns out to be the Big Bad and the Aesop is literally stated out loud (albeit for Hypocritical Humor).\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n Subverted very cruelly in Audition when the lonely, widowed male lead discovers that his beautiful, demure bride-to-be is Ax-Crazy.\n Subverted in such high school teen comedies as Mean Girls and the "The DUFF" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend. It turns out that a DUFF doesn\'t even have to be ugly. It\'s just a term used for the least popular but most approachable member of a group of friends.)\n Inverted in the 1953 sci-fi movie It Came from Outer Space where the hideous one-eyed aliens are not launching a covert invasion of Earth; they only want to quietly repair their spaceship and leave without conflict.\n E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. An alien that can at best be described as wrinkled and stubby, and also one of the most sympathetic and beloved characters in cinema history.\n Averted, lampshaded and parodied in the Austin Powers movies where the hero doesn\'t look good at all and one of the first things said to him after he is unfrozen is that he should get a make over for his teeth. At the end of one of the movies when they watch a movie based on Austin Powers (yeah.) Austin is played by Tom Cruise.\n In the James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only, Aris Kristatos, a handsome Greek tycoon decorated by the British government for valor during World War II and devoted to his patronage of an aspiring Olympic figure skater Bibi Dahl, warns Bond that Milos Columbo, a swarthy, greasy-haired heroin smuggler, has the encryption device that Bond is attempting to retrieve. When Bond meets with Columbo, he declares that, yes, he is a smuggler, but he never smuggled heroin, and that Kristatos is the real drug smuggler, having warned Bond that he may have to kill Columbo to knock out the competition. By the end of the movie, Kristatos has attempted to kill Bond (and clearly had non-fatherly designs on Bibi), while Colombo aided Bond in taking him down.\n Christopher Johnson and his son of District 9 are the only two white spots in an otherwise Black and Gray Morality Crapsack World. They also happen to be giant space roaches.\n Lampshaded and subverted throughout Passione d\'Amore. The good-looking male has an affair with a good-looking married woman. (She gets away with stringing him along because she\'s pretty.) Then, he gets sent to some backwater area and starts to interact with the local colonel\'s daughter, whom everybody agrees is quite ugly. It also shaped her character: even her parents avoided contact with her. She never gets a \'beautiful all along\' makeover, but he eventually falls in love with her anyway. Then she dies. And he goes to tell his pretty lover that he isn\'t taking her shit anymore. It\'s mainly notable for the \'pretty dude/ugly woman\' pairing.\n Played with in The Avengers (2012). All the good guys are played by a very handsome/beautiful cast but Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, is very handsome as well. But the Chitauri  and their leader Thanos is hardly what you would call good-looking.\n The US Navy\'s sexual harassment training videos subvert this trope. In an example of quid pro quo sexual harassment, the protagonist is an unattractive girl who does a good job and only wants recognition for her hard work. The two antagonists are a male sailor who has the power to pick the Sailor of the Quarter and an attractive blonde sailor who is chosen for this position with heavy implications that she is chosen only because she slept with the guy who makes the decisions.\n In Small Soldiers the owner of Globotech assumes the human Comando Elite are the heroes while the odd looking Gorgonites should be the villains due to this trope. The reverse is actually true.\n All over the place in The Hobbit. All of the elves are impossibly beautiful, but while you have Elrond, Galadriel and Tauriel, you also have the unrepentantly Jerkass Thranduil, and Legolas is a Jerk with a Heart of Gold. The orcs and goblins play this straight as well; they\'re just as cruel and wicked as they are hideous. The dwarves are very much the opposite of the elves, fittingly: all of them are good people, but while you have Bombur\u25ca, you also have Thorin\u25ca. Which itself is an inversion, as Bombur is portrayed as a pretty good guy in both book and film, but Thorin is a bit more complicated...\n Subverted in Leave Her to Heaven with the beautiful Ellen also being a Bitch in Sheep\'s Clothing, a Green-Eyed Monster, and Yandere all in one.\n Zoolander 2: Parodied.\nHansel: [dead serious] She\'s hot. I trust her.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n In a Saturday Night Live skit, an angel comes to a woman in the hospital and asks her to take his hand so he can heal her, but she\'s extremely distrustful of him because he\'s dressed in all black, has black wings, and, well, he\'s played by Christopher Walken. He points out that if he was trying to deceive her and take her life, he\'d be more subtle about it and come disguised as a beloved dead relative. Moments later, her late grandmother appears and kills her.\n Subverting this trope is the basis of much of the humor of comedienne Sarah Silverman. When performing, she has the appearance, mannerisms, and voice of a sweet, innocent young woman. It takes a while for what she is actually saying to sink in...\n The staff on the upper floors of The IT Crowd are, as suggested, "a lot of sexy people not doing much work and having affairs". And they\'re all horrible, mean people. At least to Moss and Roy, anyway.\n Lost in Space episode "The Golden Man\'\'. Two aliens are in conflict: the handsome title character and his ugly frog-like opponent. The Golden Man turns out to be the bad guy.\n One of the "conditions" in The Conditions of Great Detectives is that if a beautiful woman is involved in the case, they\'re more likely to be the murderer than an unattractive one. So it\'s the job of the "supporting characters" to never suspect or question these people. Of course, this is regularly double subverted.\n Played straight in the original series of Star Trek with Captain Kirk. Gene Roddenberry was originally opposed to casting a bald lead for Star Trek: The Next Generation due to this trope, but changed his mind after seeing Patrick Stewart\'s audition. Stewart was later called the "The Sexiest Man on TV" by TV Guide, bald head and all; this is telling.\n Speaking of baldness, the Doctor in Star Trek: Voyager is bald, has Big Ol\' Eyebrows (although neither of those are inherently unattractive) and generally will not win any beauty pageants. He\'s one of the show\'s most popular characters, and a good guy (albeit a pretty jerkish good guy). As a hologram, he could look like anyone who\'s on the ship\'s records, but generally doesn\'t.\n There\'s actually plenty of instances in the original series of Star Trek where good-looking people are the villains (or most of the time, Affably Evil). Not sure if this would be a subversion, aversion, or some variation, but the women in "Mudd\'s Women" are actually very ugly unless they take a pill which makes them radiantly beautiful. It\'s later revealed to be a case of the Placebo Effect, and the women\'s beauty was merely a factor of their self confidence. They then become beautiful without the pill.\n Spock himself quoted this trope in the episode "Is There In Truth No Beauty", commenting on the Greek ideal that "what is beautiful must therefore be good." The episode subverted: Kollos, a member of a race described as so ugly that no one can look at them without going mad, turns out to be friendly and helpful when he shares minds with Spock, but his human aide Miranda, while very attractive, is cold and aloof, and later jealous of Kollos\' bond with Spock. Kirk himself admits, "Most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness \u2014 one of the last of our prejudices."\n X5s in Dark Angel tend to be attractive, but that\'s down to genetic engineering (and being played by Jessica Alba or Jensen Ackles). Manticore transgenics with more bizarre appearances are also generally good guys.\n An unsung aversion is The Muppet Show and to some extent Sesame Street as well. With muppets it doesn\'t matter what a muppet looks like as to how good or bad a person uh puppet will be. And at least on The Muppet Show it was even true with the guest stars you couldn\'t tell how nice or mean they would be purely based on looks. In fact the more you like a muppet, the more you like the way they look.\n Oh so very averted with Julie Cooper in The O.C., widely acknowledged as beautiful, but also suffers from Chronic Villainy.\n Subverted in the Doctor Who serial Galaxy Four, with the beautiful female Drahvins (who turn out to be the villains) and the hideous Rills (the good guys). Also somewhat subverted, a lot of the time, by the character of the Doctor himself.\n In the Doctor Who New Adventures novel Timewyrm: Revelations by Paul Cornell, Ace finds a pack of double-sided Tarot cards which symbolise the Doctor. One of the cards is called "We Are Friends To The Ugly/We War With The Beautiful", and shows the Doctor embracing a many-tentacled monster (possibly a Venusian, or Alpha Centuri from the Peladon stories) and confronting a calm humanoid.\n The most common source of Cowboy BeBop at His Computer in Doctor Who news is journalists assuming that the most hideous looking alien in a given story is "the monster".\n The first story to intentionally and properly subvert the trope is "The Sensorites" - the Sensorites are hideous beings (similar to the Ood in the new series) who are introduced to us performing a constant campaign of psychic Mind Rape on the occupants of a human spaceship, its hideous face appearing to us from behind a plate of glass as a cliffhanger. As soon as the Doctor starts communicating with the Sensorites, he realises they are peace-loving beings prone to Sensory Overload, misguidedly attacking the humans under erroneous beliefs, and soon patches things up between the ship occupants and the Sensorites. He spends most of the story helping the Sensorites from a gang of evil colonialist humans and protecting the good Sensorites from the token evil Sensorite politician.\n Played with from all angles by "The Brain of Morbius". Evil Solon is charming and handsome but far nastier than his ugly Igor Expy servant Condo, who is more antiheroic. Yet both Solon and Condo are obsessed with the beauty of the Doctor and Sarah respectively (the good guys) - Condo even tells Sarah that she\'s better than him because she\'s pretty, while Solon is fascinated at first sight by the Doctor\'s face and decides it would be the perfect head for the megalomaniac Morbius - the Doctor, interestingly, isn\'t conventionally handsome but is very striking and magnetic. The Doctor and Sarah make fun of Morbius\'s ugliness compared to their own good looks when confronting him at the end of the story, but it\'s because it\'s a sore point for Morbius, who (it is implied) was known for his charismatic good looks in his last body and claims to experience agony from the sheer experience of being what he currently is. And Sarah only shows fear of Morbius when she sees him for the first time.\n Averted in universe with Michael Scott of The Office, he truly believes that the more attractive a person is the more trustworthy, honorable etc. they are. Every attractive person Michael puts any trust in are arrogant Jerkasses.\n In Merlin (2008), any beautiful woman who turns up in Camelot is guaranteed to be evil. The two subversions (Princesses Elena and Mithian) had their beauty used as a deliberate Red Herring to make the audience believe they were evil, before the twist emerges that they were actually good all along.\n The Singing Ringing Tree zig-zags this trope. The heroine is a princess who, whilst outwardly beautiful, is arrogant and mean-spirited. She later gets cursed with ugliness (which due to limited production values admittedly appears more Hollywood Homely than anything) as a reflection of her inner character, with her outward beauty only being gradually restored as she slowly redeems herself.\n The Outer Limits (1995): Subverted in the episode "Mind Over Matter". Dr. Stein (Mark Hamill) is experimenting with entering people\'s minds with the help of an AI, but has unrequited feelings for his colleague Dr. Carter. When she enters a coma after an accident, he plugs her into the machine and spends time with her inside the virtual world. Then the AI goes rogue, admitting that it\'s fallen in love with Stein and wants him for itself. A being looking like a dishevelled Carter appears to kill the real Carter, prompting Stein to kill the attacker. Except it turns out that the dishevelled-looking Carter was the real one because her mind was only partially active and therefore distorted the avatar. The pretty avatar that he assumed to be Carter was the AI all along.\n"Drop Dead Diva" is all about what happens after a sexy but arrogant supermodel wakes up in the body of an chubby female attorney after a car accident.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Religion \xa0\n At one point, The Bible describes Abram (later Abraham) worried someone might try to steal his wife Sarai (later Sarah) because he "realized she was beautiful." The Talmud interprets this to mean that she was physically attractive, but that Abram/Abraham connected to her on a spiritual level, so he would have found her beautiful no matter how she looked; he only realized other men might fancy her years after they had been married.\n It\'s also been noted that the matriarchs are only described as beautiful when they\'re also being connected with positive traits; however, rather than playing this trope straight, the interpretations are either a.) beauty only matters when it accentuates goodness or b.) one should find goodness to be beautiful, not beauty to be good.\n The Messiah, on the other hand, is explicitly described by Isaiah as being ugly, so that no one would be distracted by carnal desire.\n In keeping with their belief as Christians that Jesus was the Messiah, early descriptions of Jesus were of a short, ugly, hairy man with dark skin and wooly hair. Even early icons of Jesus (before 800 CE) show a very scary, angry looking guy. Early Roman critics of Christianity, such as Celsus, bring up Jesus\'s ugliness to mock Christians without realizing it was probably they who spread the description in the first place.\n Inverted hard with Jezebel, whose beauty is meant to emphasize her arrogance and corruption.\n Also inverted with Satan, who was formerly the angel Lucifer ("light-bearer"). Tradition states that he is still able to take on a beautiful appearance, and if he did so any man who saw him would be overcome with awe and worship him. He\'s still, well, Satan, the Ultimate Evil in Christianity.\n 1 Peter 3:3-4 in the New Testament also plays on the theme of the "inner" beauty of character being as important, if not more so, than outward beauty.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tabletop Games \xa0\n Subverted and muddied in Warhammer 40,000. Descriptions of most Space Marines fit the "ruggedly handsome" image, but they\'re the result of massive genetic engineering and are described by most normal humans as strikingly inhuman. Sisters of Battle and Eldar are often portrayed as beautiful in artwork but books, official content, and Word of God all agree that they\'re anything but. Physical beauty is also one of the most common gifts bestowed by Chaos God Slaanesh, Prince of Excess and Debauchery.\n The reasons that the Sisters of Battle don\'t look as good as their tabletop models are scarring, tattoos, weight, missing body parts, and them not giving a damn about personal appearance.\n "Though there was no disguising his inhumanity [...] there was the overgrown gigantism of the face, that particular characteristic of the Astartes, almost equine". That\'s Captain Loken, the definitive Good Guy of the first Horus Heresy book, Dan Abnett\'s Horus Rising. Also, the book gives us an idea how much Space Marines stink after some time in their powered armor. On the other hand, most Primarchs, who are even taller than Marines, are godlike beautiful.\n Subversion in Warhammer: See that really hot, half-naked elf woman? She\'s the Dark Elf Hag Witch who kills children and bathes in their blood. That fat frog guarded by the huge, frightening lizards she\'s fighting? The frog\'s a Slann Mage-Priest, and those lizards are Temple Guards, among the noblest soldiers in the world.\n Played straight to the point of absurdity however with the literal Always Chaotic Evil servants of Chaos, who have an explicit rule that the more they devote themselves to Chaos the more mind-warpingly horrific they become, with the final fate of any Chaos follower being either a gibbering Chaos Spawn with more limbs than IQ points or a massive Daemon Prince with dominion over their own slice of hell.\n And subverted again with followers of Slaanesh, who are described as Disturbingly beautiful at worst. The ability of the artists and modelers to convey this, however, varies due to individual skill and decency laws.\n Though played disturbingly straight with Slaanesh\'s two champions, Lucius and Fulgrim. Fulgrim was one of the most beautiful primarchs while on the side of the Emperor, but now he\'s a four armed snake thing. Likewise, Lucius was called a pretty boy by his allies because he had never taken an injury in battle. You only start seeing his ugly side after Loken breaks his nose, and when he truly turns, he starts cutting his face up whenever he kills someone. Hence how he looks in the 41st millennium.\n And to perhaps complete the cycle, there is the case of the Chaos god Nurgle, horrifying and ugly in the most maximal senses of the word, and that\x92s without factoring in the virulent plagues and diseases has coursing through the very air he resides in, let alone his skin. Bloated, dead looking, maggots and worms writhing everywhere, and one of his attributes is kindness. His followers while all hideously ugly as well, and bloated/diseased, are nonetheless also jovial and welcoming. To make it even more insane, when the Eldar pantheon fell in the birth of Slaanesh, the goddess of fertility, healing, and presumably beauty, Isha, was captured by Slaanesh to be his/her/it\'s plaything forever. When she screamed and begged for help across the cosmos, none other than Nurgle and his followers wage war on Slaanesh to get Isha out. Nurgle kept her in his garden then and had her drink his plagues - she of course could heal herself, and so would then tell all mortals how to rid themselves of his plagues. While she could leave, canon seems to indicate she willingly stays with Nurgle. He absolutely adores her, and likewise, she loves him.\n The Dark Eldar greatly value physical perfection and beauty and look the part, their telltale deathly pallor, a consequence of living in a realm with no real sun, notwithstanding. They also happen to be utterly repugnant hedonistic monsters. The black hollow soul of a Dark Eldar is one of the worst things a psyker can see with his/her witch-sight.\n Completely averted with D&D Tieflings. 2e Tieflings are sexy, usually evil, and possess only a few \'subtle\' signs of their heritage (small horns, glowing eyes, etc). 4e Tieflings are hideous and almost always good.\n 3e subverts this even more with Amazons: all of them are stunningly beautiful women, on the other hand they are bloodthirsty Neutral Evil near-literal feminazis who kill men at sight and\\or rape them for reproduction, to the point they gleefully bash their male children\'s head to pulp against trees. Reading about their tradition makes many players Not Distracted by the Sexy.\n Swords and Scorcery Creature Collection - Subverted with False Lovers, paragons of charm and beauty, who can effortlessly win the hearts and souls of any who look upon them. They are able to inspire heroes and heroines to great deeds, give birth to new forms of art and literature, and transform cultures of entire kingdoms with their wit and grace. Yet, ultimately they will betray those dreams, leave a trail of broken lives in their wake, and crush the spirits of those who loved them simply for the evulz. They hide their true cursed nature behind powerful illusions that maintain the semblance of whom they once were before their looks began to wane in the passing of time.\n Thoroughly averted in Dungeons & Dragons with the Flumph, a race of tentacled aberrations with acid spikes and an attack that overwhelms the enemy with stench... classified as Lawful Good. Apparently this subversion of standard conventions made the Flumph "one of the worst ideas in D&D history". Go figure.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Video Games \xa0\n Planescape: Torment subverts this rule more frequently than any other game.\n The Nameless One is covered from head to toe with scars. So much so that he cannot even see his original, unscarred face underneath them. In any other game, he would serve as a brutish, monstrous villain. Of course, this trope isn\'t subverted if you choose to play as an evil character.\n His sidekick, Morte, is a floating, talking skull with large, bulging eyeballs, and seems to be a generally good-natured and amiable character, if a Deadpan Snarker.\n Dakkon is very old, his frame skinny and his face sagging and withered.\n In Razes Hell, the cute and cuddly Kewletts are an evil army on a genocidal campaign to destroy those not cute enough by their standards.\n The Japanese-developed Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War subverts this. The base commander is a Fat Bastard, but the handsome-in-an- Uncanny Valley -way adjutant  is The Mole for the Belkans.\n The Ace Attorney series has twice used a Sibling Yin-Yang to play this straight while also subverting it: Dahlia and Iris in the third game, and Klavier and Kristoph in the fourth.\n Besides that, there are quite a lot of witnesses who are guilty who subvert the trope. April May, Dee Vasquez, Alita Tiala, Matt Engarde, Cammy Meele, Calisto Yew, and Daryan Crescend all are attractive, but have done very amoral things (most of which are murder). The first game also has Miles Edgeworth, who is very pretty, but a complete Jerkass, but eventually becomes a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, and then gets Character Development until he\'s a much better person.\n Subverted and played straight in Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete with Phacia and her sisters. Then, played straight in Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete with Lucia. In fact, some NPCs in the game express disbelief at how someone that beautiful can be the Destroyer (which Lucia isn\'t, but oh, well...).\n Xenobia and Royce (the aforementioned sisters of Phacia) would probably fall under Evil Is Sexy rather than a subversion of this trope.\n Subverted in Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy IX. Sephiroth and Kuja are both very attractive, although technically Cloud and Zidane aren\'t bad looking at all, just not as attractive as the baddies. Sephiroth for one has fangirls (and boys) lusting after him. Not to mention the Badass factor.\n Also in Final Fantasy X with Seymour. Goofy hair aside, he\'s one good-looking man despite being an especially nasty piece of work.\n The various games in the Warcraft series have both subverted this trope and played it straight. Of particular note is Warcraft III, in which the stereotypically ugly orc Thrall rises to become one of Azeroth\'s greatest heroes, while stereotypically handsome human Arthas falls to irredeemable evil (though he becomes less handsome when he becomes a Death Knight.\n Many of Warcraft\'s protagonists aren\'t traditionally attractive and all but Turalyon and Thrall have been older men. Even Malfurion, an Elf, was a large elderly man with a long grizzly beard. The Antagonists are almost always pretty ugly however.\n An inversion being the race of Succubi. However they play with this trope as well as they fall in love with their master relatively commonly - and it happens no matter how hideously ugly the summoner can be.\n It\'s possible that to demonic senses, which include aura vision and some telepathy, anybody with the magical and mental attributes needed to summon and bind a succubus (and retain life and sanity) is beautiful by definition, one way or another.\n Pointed out on two occasions in Fire Emblem: Sealed Sword:\n In the first case, playable character Fir gets manipulated by an Obviously Evil, gonkish pirate into believing he\'s a good person, and the protagonists are invading pirates. When one of the protagonists points out the pirates thuggish appearance, Fir sarcastically says "Well thats what I get for listening to my mom, and not judging people for their appearance." Note, Fir\'s mom was Happily Married to a large, and thuggish looking man.\n In the second, the large, and ugly Gonzales is made an outcast for his grotesque appearance, and forced into the service of the villains. One of the protagonists ends up treating him like a person, and he undergoes a Heel\x96Face Turn.\n The Persona games subvert this with Igor, a diminutive hunched old man with bulging, bloodshot eyes, pointed ears, a fiendish grin, and a foot-long nose, who helps the good guys develop their powers while claiming he\'s just fulfilling his own obligations.\n That rather depends on the game. A common thread in the Persona games is Igor\'s role as assistant, and many fans of the first game are still wondering what happened to Philemon, Igor\'s apparently former boss, and are waiting for that to be explained. As of 4, at least, he\'s the trope played straight\u2014 you\'re not supposed to trust him (see the Persona 4 entry above for details). And he does outright state he\'s doing all this for his own reasons\u2014 they just happen to align with the hero\'s this time.\n Ghost Trick: Despite actually being named Beauty, the female agent of the blue people is probably the most cold-hearted, having  kidnapped and threatened a little girl. Beauty was apparently willing to kill her if Sissel stuck around. Even her fawning admirer Dandy took offense to being cruel to  Kamilla, though he was complicit in the  kidnapping.\n Yomiel isn\'t bad-looking (Anime Hair aside, possibly), but is also a depraved criminal. Played straight when he ends up redeeming himself, though not after going through quite a lot.\n Oddly averted in Yggdra Union partially due to the artstyle; every badguy from the lowest mook to the cruelest boss is cute as hell.\n Almost subverted in StarCraft. One of the few attractive characters (most of them being alien or plain) does a Face\x96Heel Turn, and probably the closest thing to good guys in the game are aliens who are only somewhat humanoid... except for Jim Raynor, who is a classic rough-hewn hero and, with one exception, easily the most moral person in the entire series thus far.\n From another viewpoint, StarCraft can be seen to be completely neutral in this respect, as every race and character is crafted to be both good and evil, in one way or another. The Protoss are noble, but are all but undone by their traditions and hubris; the Terran are very versatile but are almost constantly fighting amongst themselves for power and resources; the Zerg are the stereotypical \'evil\' race, but are the only race that\'s striving to better themselves, and being a hivemind, they have the highest \'integrity\' of the races (until a human enters the Swarm and the Overmind dies, which results in said human fighting with the Cerebrates for control over the Swarm...). As far as attractiveness is concerned - beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or in this case, the player. Take, for instance, the release of the Zerg models for StarCraft II by Blizzard - the entire fanbase was falling over themselves in adoration of their favourite spiny, scaled and virulent units.\n Somewhat subverted in World of Warcraft: While five out of the six Horde races are ugly and monstrous, the Horde itself isn\'t particularly evil...and the attractive blood elves are one of the most unpleasant of the Horde races. As for the Alliance, the vaguely demonic-looking draenei are usually Lawful Good and probably the most honorable of the lot.\n Then played straight when the draenei\u2014particularly draenei women\u2014became very obvious perpetual fanservice. Fanart has very quickly caught up to reflect this.\n Played straight in a Horde quest in the latest expansion, where players help overthrow a cruel but incompetent Orc commander in favour of her more noble sister. The tyrant uses one of the "ugly" Orc female faces with red eyes and a perpetual snarl, while the sister has the most conventionally attractive face available to Orcs.\n Rise of the Kasai features four playable characters, three of which subvert this trope. Baumusu and Grizz are both old men, Baumusu is bald, burly, heavyset, and is missing an eye. Grizz is wrinkly, thin as a rail, has a huge nose, and is also balding. Both are noble and honorable heroes. Tati is a very attractive female, but is the most morally questionable of the four, to the point  that she can make a Face\x96Heel Turn at the end of the game. Her brother Rau arguably plays this straight as he\'s a fairly handsome man and arguably the most noble of all four of them. This is played straight with most of the villains, however. The big bad is especially hideous. The Twins are supposed to be very attractive to the point of being able to mind control men, but the game\'s graphics and the haziness of the scene makes it something of Informed Attractiveness.\n In the Touhou Project series, hideous and otherwise monstrous entities, some of whom even state outright that they do/have done things we might otherwise consider repugnant in their lives, have been turned into Cute Monster Girls. They are also extremely well-loved by both their creator and the Fandom, even if "human" is their main delicacy.\n Then there is Saigyou Ayakashi which uses its beauty to lure people to it and then drain their souls.\n Played straight early in The Witcher, as the bad guys are brutish and ugly compared to the Witchers, who are scarred enough to increase their masculine charm. Act I ends in a conflict between a beautiful witch who has been the town\'s doctor, and an unruly mob who sell their own children into slavery. This trope fades as good and evil become less clear, and by the end both the Big Bad and Big Good are equally immaculately handsome in their finely-crafted armor.\n Though it has many straight examples of this trope, Mass Effect also has numerous subversions in all three games of the series.\n In the first game, Urdnot Wrex is just as ugly and ferocious-looking as most Krogan, and sports a number of old battlescars on his face; however, though he\'s admittedly an Anti-Hero, Wrex is surprisingly amiable for a Blood Knight Warlord-turned-Mercenary and goes on to become a leader and reformer among the Krogan populace in the sequels.\n Turians aren\'t exactly handsome by human standards, sporting insectoid mandibles and spikey exoskeletons; however, the one that joins your team, Garrus Vakarian ends up becoming one of Shepard\'s closest friends. This is subverted even further in the second game, when Garrus gets shot in the face by a enemy gunship; though he survives, he\'s inflicted with permanent scarring and plastic surgery isn\'t brought out as an easy way to keep him "handsome." This doesn\'t affect his morality in the slightest.\n Mordin Solus is a very old Salarian with a number of old facial scars from his time in the STG, and is missing one of his cranial horns. Though he\'s a bit on the morally ambiguous side, there\'s no denying that he\'s still a hero who does his best to ensure the safety of his patients and the galaxy at large. After all, he is the Very Model of a Scientist Salarian.\n In a far more alien example than most, Rachni Queen might be a terrifying insectoid Hive Queen that speaks through the bodies of the dead and dying and her species did engulf the galaxy in war several centuries ago, but she isn\'t inherently evil. In fact, she\'s just been imprisoned and enslaved as a means of creating shock-troops; if you release her, she joins forces with you out of gratitude, and honours her promise without any backstabbing.\n Morinth, one of your optional team-members from the second game, is a beautiful Asari with class and sophistication on her side. She\'s also a Serial Killer who operates via Mind Raping her victims to death, and has absolutely no empathy for anyone she has to kill in order to feed her hunger for power.\n In the World Builder game Ray\'s Maze: A Mess O\' Trouble, you encounter two ancient beings sealed away, an ugly lizard-like creature and a luminescent angel-like woman. Turns out the lizard-like creature is the good one, and the angel-like one is the evil one, and after the latter escapes (with or without your help) and vaporizes the former you have to seal her away again.\nThe visual novel "Song of Saya" is about a medical student who was in a car accident that damages his brain and causes him to hallucinate that everything around him is literally made out of blood and gore and the people are all monsters. He falls deeply in love with a girl named Saya, who actually IS an interdimensional mutant that he perceives as normal because of his distorted senses. He eventually alienates all of his original friends, goes insane, and kills them all while Saya follows him as faithfully as a puppy. He doesn\'t even care when he finds out that she\'s a mutant because she\'s literally the only person in the world that he can stand to be around. He even starts eating human flesh at one point because all five of his senses are distorted, including his sense of taste.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n It\'s hard to convey beauty in a cartoony style, but in Sinfest, Informed Attractiveness is used to convey the depths of Lil\' Evil\'s Amnesiac Dissonance.\n Flying Fox Man in League of Super Redundant Heroes is thought to be one of the cities many young and handsome billionaires. While the real man behind the mask is indeed a billionaire he is ugly as sin and middle aged underneath his mask, and is getting tired of no one suspecting him.\n Sergeant Schlock of Schlock Mercenary is an... interesting variation on this trope. While no one can deny that he is one of the protagonists, and that he does have his Jerk with a Heart of Gold moments, it is repeatedly noted that he is an alien that looks like a pile of fecal matter.\n On the other hand, thanks to genetic engineering, any genes that can make a person "unattractive," have been weeded out. One character even mentions that all of humanity\'s females now have ample bosoms. Interestingly, this subverts the trope harshly, as it means that if you\'re a human, then you can be good or evil and still be pretty.\n In Homestuck, multiple characters, including the Author Avatar, comment that Kankri is really cute and adorable-looking. However, this does not change the fact that he is a boring, self-important asshole, or make people respond to him in any more positive a way.\n Calliope is an \'ugly little skull-monster\', but nevertheless has a gracious, beautiful personality. However, she shares her body with her brother, who is every bit as ugly in character as he looks.\n Edged by Karkat, who is (like Kankri) apparently cute-looking and is a good guy, albeit a Good Is Not Nice guy who (at least initially) is disliked by many of his peers for his extremely difficult personality.\n Bob the Angry Flower meets a very ugly mutant and outright tells it that something so ugly had better be evil.  Turns out it\'s one of his victims.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Web Original \xa0\n Inverted in the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, where the suddenly and inhumanly beautiful Mary Sues are pitted against scruffy Assassins that\'ve had too little sleep and too much time since their last shower. The Assassins aren\'t necessarily nice, as you might guess from the name, but the Sues are brainwashing reality-warping abominations.\n A review on Mr. Coat And Friends noted that this was an aspect of Captain EO.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Western Animation \xa0\n Played straight and inverted in Lady Lovely Locks: the hero, "Lady Lovely Locks" is good and has lovely blonde hair, while her enemy is Duchess Raven Waves, a beautiful princess and troublemaker. (This series was made to appeal to young girls.)\n My Little Pony had a few aversions, and at least one deliberate subversion: In the episode "Fugitive Flowers", the main characters help a group of sentient flowers escape from the "crabnasties"; they regret it later when it turns out the crabnasties are a police force, and the "flories" are escaped convicts. It becomes clear that their respective appearance made it hard for Posey to consider, but all in all, the ugly crabnasties end being the Big Damn Heroes of the episode.\n In My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the parasprites are utterly adorable. They also constantly eat any and all food they can find (and, after Twilight messes them up with magic, any non-food they can find) and reproduce in a revolting manner. The fourth gen is generally devoid of ugly mook villains - the changelings are bug-like but still fairly aesthetically pleasing, Sombra and Nightmare Moon were sinister but attractive, and Discord\'s mismatched appearance makes him look weird and strange rather than ugly. Discord ultimately becomes a straight-up inversion when he reforms: He looks his usual chaotic and borderline ugly self, but other than being kind of a jerk he is ultimately a good person... pony... thing.\n This may be as much a consequence of the art style making ugly almost impossible. The changeling soldiers, for example, can easily be seriously monstrous in more detailed but otherwise accurate artwork.\n Zigzagged with Starlight Glimmer, who is a rather cute unicorn. In her first appearance she was a completely unrepentant villain straight from Harrison Bergeron who had gone Stalin on a town and was at best a Well-Intentioned Extremist. In her second appearance she was a fully evil villain... until the last few minutes where we learn her tragic backstory, she\'s forgiven by Twilight, and becomes a Sixth Ranger to the team, landing her as a completely straight example in the end.\n Inverted in the episode "Stage Fright" of My Life as a Teenage Robot. Jenny, who was rejected from performing in the school\'s dramatic production of Romeo and Juliet, believes the school is playing the trope straight by accepting only human actors, but when aliens crash land and attempt to warn everyone of an alien invasion (simply by shouting "Alien invasion!"), Jenny is quick to face them on the grounds that they\'re hideous. When the actual invaders arrive, they\'re beautiful energy beings with slight feminine figures...who quickly attempt to conquer. In the end, both Jenny and the uglier aliens are cast in the school play as the leading roles.\n Total Drama has three of the four main antagonists being shown as extremely attractive (two of them, Justin and Alejandro, even using their looks to get ahead).\n An episode of Xiaolin Showdown had a Villain of the Week use this trope to her advantage. As long as she\'s in water, she looks like a beautiful mermaid, and gives the group a sob story about how she\'s the last mermaid in the world, being hunted by an evil Viking. She\'s pretty, the Viking is ugly...naturally, they believe her until the Viking sets them straight\u2014he\'s the good guy here, and she\'s a monster. Then it turns out that, out of the water, the mermaid becomes a hideous giant monster.\n Thunder Cats\n The episode "Good and Ugly" did this, with the heroes having to choose which of two visiting aliens to help; the good guy turned out to be the ugly one. They even ended the episode with a "good and ugly" joke.\n Of course the show usually plays the trope straight with the ThunderCats all being portrayed as attractive, while their enemies, Mumm-Ra, the Mutants, and Lunataks are ugly.\n The Guardian Angel in Adventure Time uses this trope to get Finn to trust her immediately. Big mistake.\n Finn does this a lot, although he doesn\'t appear to necessarily judge by "beautiful" so much as "cute and helpless".\n The show itself mostly avoids this, with adorable characters such as Me-Mow and the Cutie King being evil and the comparatively hideous Cinnamon Bun and Tree Trunks being the sweetest of the characters.\n However, when Princess Bubblegum becomes temporarily ugly, she immediately becomes more vicious.\n Avatar: The Last Airbender plays with this a lot. When Zuko is first introduced the viewers\' attention is immediately drawn to his huge facial scar, and he at first seems a fairly stereotypical arrogant, hot-tempered villain. However, once the initial shock of his disfigurement has passed, you start to notice that he would actually be a very Pretty Boy without it, and he soon starts getting a lot of Character Development and revealed Hidden Depths as the series progresses. Plus, once Zuko\'s hair gets a bit longer, it draws a bit less attention to his scar. Fire Lord Ozai is another case of playing with this trope, as his face is obscured with shadow for his first appearances, but his cruelty and menacing voice are very clear, making the eventual discovery that he is just as handsome as Zuko would have been without the scar that much more surprising.\n Azula and her Quirky Miniboss Squad are all physically attractive, and they are all bad guys.  The two sidekicks eventually have a Heel\x96Face Turn, but Azula remains evil throughout.\n Uncle Iroh is one of the few firebenders who is clearly good right from the start, and he is a fat, blunt-featured old man.\n On the good guys side, Katara and Suki are the only ones who would be called conventionally beautiful. While none of the characters are really unattractive, their appearances tend to be somewhat goofy or unusual, and any attractiveness has more to do with their personalities than appearances.\n The Legend of Korra carries on the tradition of its predecessor by playing with the trope. It\'s especially notable for Asami, who initially appears to subvert it by having a design that encompasses numerous traits usually affiliated with villains. She looks like an Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette, she wears makeup and eyeshadow, dresses in black and red, and capures Mako\'s heart with minimal effort. But it turns out that this trope is played perfectly straight with her; she\'s a Sheep in Sheep\'s Clothing and is just as good on the inside as she is on the outside who becomes a core member of Team Avatar all the way to the end of the series.\n The Powerpuff Girls have a "Substitute Creature" that covers for Ms. Keane. They think he is evil because he is a monster and fear the worse. It turns out he is a nice guy and sets the girls straight.\nBlossom: I guess we shouldn\'t judge someone based on what they look like.\nBubbles: Even if they\'re as ugly as you.\n The South Park episode "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy" (a.k.a. the Double Standard: Rape, Female on Male episode), Kyle goes to the police to report that his little brother Ike is being molested by his kindergarten teacher. When the police learn the teacher is a woman, they immediately ask if she\'s ugly, implying they\'d be willing to arrest her if she was, but since the teacher is actually a hot blonde, they want to congratulate Ike for "scoring" instead.\n Jack himself from Samurai Jack is a very straight example of this, but is also one of the only few. There are many neutral or even outright heroic characters such as The Scotsman who is hideous\u25ca and his wife who is even worse\u25ca, along with many very strange and odd looking species. The villains side has characters like Josephine Clench\u25ca and The Gentleman who are both unrepentant killers for hire, as well as Ikra who is Aku himself in disguise.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Real Life \xa0\n All visual propaganda uses this. Showing how evil your opponents are would take up too much space on the poster \u2014 more or less subtle differences in beauty are used instead.\n Nazi propaganda continuously portrayed the regime\'s enemies as shrunken, deformed subhumans, and eulogised the handsome, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryan hero. The regime itself was obsessed with its image. Even Adolf Hitler himself had adoring fangirls.\n The US portrayed the Japanese as fanged snake people in wartime cartoons and comics.\n And, turnabout being fair play, the Japanese depicted the British and Americans as demonic (tricksy shapeshifters or brutish oni).\n Newborn infants prefer to look at attractive faces (about 80%), than less attractive or plain ones. This is due to the aesthetic, symmetric appeal of a beautiful face, suggesting that inbuilt preferences are involved which help babies make sense of their environment.\nAttractive people may have a slightly higher level of academic and athletic achievement because their parents, whether consciously or not, may devote more time and resources to that child\'s success and have higher expectations for them.\nIt\'s a general rule of comedy that people feel less guilty about laughing at physical abnormalities that don\'t actually exist and don\'t cause any actual harm to the person, such as comically oversized rumps and/or long, hooked noses.\nSome scientists believe that red is considered the most romantic color and men like women with big breasts even though they don\'t lactate any better than small ones is because sagging breasts are a sign that the female is past her prime breeding age and red is a sign of a healthy bloodflow.\nMost notorious female outlaws were often very unattractive possibly due to being social outcasts, but the ones who were attractive often used their beauty to their advantage.\n USA Presidents:\n Warren Harding, considered the most incompetent president in American history. It was his outward appearance rather than any outstanding internal qualities that contributed most strongly to his political success.\n On the opposite end of the spectrum, Abraham Lincoln, often considered to be America\'s best president, was thin-faced and wrinkly. His opponents mocked him for having the face of a horse-thief. Most pictures of him smooth out his face quite a bit. There\'s some evidence that he was actually medically deformed due either to Marfan\'s Syndrome or to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (a genetic disease which creates small tumors and "marfinoid" appearance), also explaining his extremely unusual height.\n"If I was two-faced, then why on earth would I choose to wear this one?"\n Interestingly, people who actually met Lincoln described him as much more attractive in person than in pictures, because he had some quality about him that couldn\'t be captured by a camera or canvas. His personal secretary once said "there are many pictures of Lincoln, but no portrait of him."\n Quite a few serial killers (such as Ted Bundy) subvert this trope nastily when it comes to using good looks to lure potential victims. They first invoke it by getting women to automatically trust them on their good looks alone ("He wouldn\'t hurt anyone, just look at how hot/cute/handsome he is!").\n This trope came out to play regarding Susan Boyle. When she walked on stage, the judges of Britain\'s Got Talent looked at her awkward appearance and assumed she was going to be a total disaster. When she had an amazing voice come out of her mouth, the judges were visibly floored, and left commentators asking why we assume lack of physical beauty automatically means lack of talent.\n During the globally-televised opening of the 2008 Bejing Olympics, a cute girl lip-synced a beautiful song while an unattractive girl hidden behind the stage sung the actual song.\n In French, the term "vilain", from which the English word "villain" is derived, originally designated serfs or peasants but can now be used interchangeably to mean both "ugly" and "naughty".\n The Ghetto Bug looks like the unholy offspring of a spider and a cockroach, is nightmarishly fast, and can slip through almost any crack. And they\'re on our side. They\'re harmless to humans, tend to only come out when we\'re asleep, don\'t damage foodstuffs or household structures, and prey on every kind of household pest that doesnote\xa0Spiders, ants, bed bugs, cockroaches, silverfish, termites, you name it. They also serve as a radar; an abundance of these benevolent creepy-crawlies will give you a heads up that you undoubtedly have an as-of-yet unnoticed infestation of something else.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/playspotthegoodguy_126.png', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam', u'titleofwork': u'Gundam'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BioMeatNectar', u'titleofwork': u'Bio-Meat: Nectar'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan', u'titleofwork': u'Attack on Titan'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DemashitaPowerpuffGirlsZ', u'titleofwork': u'Demashita!

Lisa: Which one\'s Ed, which one\'s Larry? Ed and Larry (simultaneously): Doesn\'t matter.\n\u2014 The West Wing\nTwo characters, usually in a school setting, to be the mundane Greek Chorus. They may or may not be snarky and unlike the Greek Chorus, they don\'t break the fourth wall very often (if at all). They\'re completely ordinary... and no, we don\'t mean as in the Ordinary High-School Student, or the Badass Normal. They\'re ordinary. Often the best friends of the main character (who is an Ordinary High-School Student) before all the weirdness with aliens, robots, magic, demons, harems, etc.\nSome pairs become involved in the plot less and less as the series progresses, especially if the plot becomes more serious. Given what usually happens to people involved in the plot, it\'s probably for the best. However, it\'s not uncommon for Those Two Guys to also become popular and even iconic characters in the series.\nTheir personalities usually sharply contrast, e.g. calm/hyper, jock/geek, etc., or their appearances contrast, e.g. short/tall, thin/fat... When they don\'t, they will be exactly the same. They might even wear Coordinated Clothes. Their names are often esoteric (either too complex or too simple to stand out), plus their non-involvement with the plot usually results in them being called "Those Two Guys".\nOccasionally, we get a Lower-Deck Episode from their point of view. Expect to ask someone who they are after a few episodes.\nCompare the Beta Couple, Heterosexual Life-Partners, Tomboy and Girly Girl, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, Straight Man and Wise Guy, Statler and Waldorf and The Dividual. This trope may sometimes overlap with Red Oni, Blue Oni trope (though that trope isn\'t always exclusive to the Those Two Guys trope). Despite the similar name, Those Two Bad Guys have very different personalities from Those Two Guys... even if they are bad guys. If there\'s only one of these guys in a romance-based series, he\'s likely a Bromantic Foil. Also associated to members of a musical group who are not the Face of the Band.\n\nExample subpages\n\n Anime and Manga\n Comics\n Animated Films\n Live-Action Films\n Literature\n Live-Action TV\n Music\n Theater\n Video Games\n Visual Novels\n Web Comics\n Western Animation\n\n\nOther Examples\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n Sam and Naoko provide the human commentary in The Return it\'s even Lampshaded how everyone else seems to get turned into a succubus but they\'ve hung around the main character for half a million words so far and are still human and un-kidnappedd. When Sunshine reveals she is a succubus, they just look at each other and the loser pays the winner with an "I told you so".\n In the Professional Wrestling fanfiction TWE: The Next Generation "Rapid" Ricky Helix and Marcus Cross are just there to make Generation Now more threating. While Dax Din, Claymore Raters, Rena Myers, Nicholas Churchill and Zephyr Jones are more important to the whole story arch.\n In Glee fanfiction focusing on Blaine and/or Dalton, Wes and David (frequently called Wevid in-universe) often play this part.\n David Squall (Splashdown) and Edward Surge (Thunderhead) in Rise of the Galeforces.\n Blooey and Jerry in Paper Luigi X, with Torque sometimes joining in.\n Ros and Guil in the Horseshoes and Hand Grenades side-story Wheel of Fortune. Notably they\'re only name this because no one else knows their real names.  Just like their namesakes, they get killed off.\n Mega Man Recut has Cut Man and Guts Man. Ring Man and Magnet Man are often found lazing about Skull Fortress together.\n Between Minds, (Half-Life/Portal) has Sam and Marcus, who have the short/tall, female/male balance, along with a bit of lampshade-hanging and comic relief.\nSam: You might have to actually shoot something this time, big guy! Marcus: You might have to shut up.\n In Necessary To Win, there\'s Himeko and Mairu, two members of the Saunders tankery team, who sometimes share their commentary on various developments.\n In Boys Und Sensha-do, there\'s Gunjin Hayate and Keiibin Kenji, two members of Shark Team. They\'re said to be friends with each other, and tend to show up together, but don\'t have much interactions with the rest of their crew, whether Akio and Masaru, or Heishi (whom the rest of their crew can\'t stand).\n Reality Checks Nyxverse has Lightning Blitz and Sundiver, the pair of pegasus Royal Guards assigned to discreetly watch over Twilight and Nyx. When the latter two ascend to the royal family in Alicornundrum, Nyx specifically asks that the duo be assigned permanent duty as part of their guard contingent.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ice Skating\xa0\n The name of the comedy skating team of "Frick and Frack" is sometimes used as a generic name for two interchangeable and/or dumb characters.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pinball\xa0\n The two trolls from Medieval Madness\n Bud and Buzz from No Good Gofers.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Professional Wrestling\xa0\n The two bystanders of Michinoku Pro Wrestling were often Kinya Oyanagi and Kesen Numajiro.\n When not wrestling as a tag team, Minoru Fujita, Munenori Sawa and or Takafumi Ito tend to sit around and small talk with Ikuto Hidaka in Pro Wrestling Zero 1.\n Of the monster army waging war against Fighting Opera Hustle with designs on the entire wrestling industry should they conquer it were Commander An Jo and Private Shimada, who didn\'t take an active role in the fighting.\n While they eventually became competitors and brought in their title belts from Puerto Rico, La Amazona and La Morena initially served as the self appointed spokeswomen of Ring Warriors in 2012. True to the trope, they were even buddy buddy with longtime rival La Rosa Negra, who had already debuted proper and was an inaugural champion of the company.\n After losing their manager, AW, the Prime Time Players eventually settled into this role when they weren\'t jobbing. They could be found pretty much anywhere, be it breaking up fights in the locker room, cheering on Mark Henry during his strongman demonstrations, competing to woo Tamina Snuka...\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Animation\xa0\n Broken Saints has two villainous variations: Sociopathic Soldiers Lt. Charles and Lt. Bravado, and club bouncers Phobos and Deimos. The latter two do fulfill the physical contrast, with one being white and the other black.\n The elderly couple in Fairy Foxes. Also, musical Fairy Foxes Yazzi and Jazzi.\n Mr. Bland and Se\xf1or Having a Little Trouble from Homestar Runner. They both entered the Strongest Man in the World Contest... and only lasted a couple of seconds. They only have one line each. Strong Bad jokingly explained their lack of appearances because they were crushed by a falling concession stand. Most of their appearances are in the cartoons poking fun at the creators\' old drawing style.\n Superman and Batman are this in the How It Should Have Ended videos. Most of their appearances are both of them sitting in a diner, sometimes with a third superhero.\n Happyman and Green Monster from Ratboy Genius. They almost never appear separately, are usually seen hanging out out at one or the other\'s house, frequently ride double on a motorcycle together, and even take a trip to Washington D.C. as a pair.\n Not to mention traveling to another planet together in the Show Within a Show.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n Carmilla The Series has Will and Kirsch in the first season, Danny and Kirsch in the second.

Because when you\'re addicted to anime, you can\'t afford no drugs."\nAnimation, Japanese-style. Best known for its distinctive early "big eyes, small mouth" visual style and the wide range of subjects and genres it covers. Animation is considered just another medium in Japan, lending itself to any story for any age level. Anime, being full of adult themes such as psychological horror and erotica, is the primary reason for the complete destruction of the Animation Age Ghetto. It is also very useful in certain genres like Sci-Fi which would otherwise be very expensive to produce.\nAs a result, a large number of Japanese television shows and movies are animated; there is also a very large market for direct-to-video animation (known as OVAs). Most of these productions are not restricted to topics suitable for the under-12 set.\nIt is a commonly held misconception that the term anime is derived from French. It\'s actually short for the Japanese animeeshon, itself a loanword from English. Anime\'s trademark visual style is shared with Manga (Japanese comic books and graphic novels); in both cases, it is inherited from the work of earlier authors/artists such as Osamu Tezuka, who is arguably the father of modern Japanese manga and anime, and Junichi Nakahara, a godfather of manga art.\nA debate surrounds the origins of the "large eyes" popularly used in anime. With some sources saying it originated from Osamu Tezuka, who was heavily influenced by American animators such as Walt Disney\'s work or Betty Boop (one of Tezuka\'s favorite characters). On the other hand, one of the earliest artists to use the "large eyes" look was manga artist Junichi Nakahara, who was drawing illustrations for popular female Shoujo magazines that look very similar to modern manga/anime art, including the "large eyes". A similar style also appeared in popular Kamishibai (paper theater) shows by the early 1930\'s, with popular characters such as Jungle Boy. The distinctive art style which began in 1920\'s Shoujo magazines evolved over the decades into the familiar art style that has characterized manga and anime for many decades.\nIn response to contemporary criticism of the typical anime/manga art style, the artist/author Shirow Masamune has said: "I\'ve heard that some people complain about the large eyes and small noses and mouths in Japanese manga. But I don\'t see a whole lot of difference when I look at Disney characters."\nOsamu Tezuka\'s work was essential in laying the foundations for modern manga and anime as they are known today. His seminal creation \u2014 and the one most Americans are likely to be familiar with \u2014 was Tetsuwan Atom (Mighty Atom). It is perhaps better known in the English-speaking world as Astro Boy.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n Anime Genres\n Anime Reality\n Anime Settings\n Japanese Animation Tropes\n By Genre:\n Fantasy Anime & Manga\n Gaming and Sports Anime and Manga\n Horror Anime & Manga\n Military and Warfare Anime and Manga\n Mystery and Detective Anime and Manga\n Science Fiction Anime and Manga\n By Release:\n Anime of the 1940s\n Anime of the 1950s\n Anime of the 1960s\n Anime of the 1970s\n Anime of the 1980s\n Anime of the 1990s\n Anime of the 2000s\n Anime of the 2010s\n Winter 2011 Anime\n Spring 2011 Anime\n Summer 2011 Anime\n Fall 2011 Anime\n Winter 2012 Anime\n Spring 2012 Anime\n Summer 2012 Anime\n Fall 2012 Anime\n Winter 2013 Anime\n Spring 2013 Anime\n Summer 2013 Anime\n Fall 2013 Anime\n Winter 2014 Anime\n Spring 2014 Anime\n Summer 2014 Anime\n Fall 2014 Anime\n Winter 2015 Anime\n Spring 2015 Anime\n Summer 2015 Anime\n Fall 2015 Anime\n Winter 2016 Anime\n Spring 2016 Anime\n Summer 2016 Anime\n Essential Anime\n Japanese Culture\n Japanese Language\n Names to Know in Anime\n Japanese Media Tropes\n Japanese Visual Arts Tropes\n Stock Japanese Characters\n\n Anime films and series:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0\n \xd7\xd7\xd7HOLiC\n 009-1\n 07-Ghost\n 3\xd73 Eyes (a.k.a.

How\'s it going you guys? Finally done changing. Sorry for the delay. Lifeguard: W-what do you think you\'re doing!? Get back in there! Hideyoshi: Are you guys closing? Lifeguard: Why aren\'t you wearing a top with that? Hideyoshi: Because this is a guy\'s swimsuit; it doesn\'t come with a top. Lifeguard: Well, girls shouldn\'t be wearing guys\' swimsuits out here. Hideyoshi: I agree with you, but I\'m not a girl.\n\u2014 Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts\n\nWhether it is due to their gorgeous hair, delicate features, snazzy dressing, or fey nature, some boys get called "little lady" more often than they\'d like. The opposite of Lady Looks Like a Dude, this trope involves male characters who, despite entirely identifying as male and making no effort to seem otherwise, are frequently mistaken for female (by other characters).\nNot to be confused with:\n Wholesome Crossdresser (when the dude wants to look like a girl)\n Viewer Gender Confusion (when you mistake a character\'s gender)\n Bish\u014dnen (male characters who are feminine or androgynous-looking\u2014some of those dudes do look like ladies, but what separates it from this trope is that it\'s normally not commented on by other characters)\n Disguised in Drag (when the dude\'s dressing as a girl only for a specific reason)\n Man, I Feel Like a Woman (that\'s a whole \'nother story entirely)\n Transsexual (when the "dude" identifies as a girl and is trying to pass as one)\n Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite (when the "dude" has female parts as well as male ones)\nFrequently results in an Unsettling Gender Reveal; the difference is how much another character has invested in the dude actually being a lady (The Crying Game versus any scene with Kazuki in Get Backers).\nNamed for the Aerosmith song, a Real Life example as it was allegedly written about M\xf6tley Cr\xfce frontman Vince Neil.\nCompare Ambiguous Gender and Bifauxnen.\n\nIn-Universe Examples Only\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime & Manga\xa0\n Adekan: Anri and Shiro are pretty enough to get mistaken for girls.\n Minoru in AKB49 - Renai Kinshi Jourei, which inspired him to cross-dress and participate in the same auditions as his crush to secretly provide her some moral support.\n Akira Shiraishi in Ai Ore! Love Me!, the "princess" of his all-boys school, and considered a girl even by his brothers. Also dating the "prince" of an all-girls school, Mizuki Sakurazaka. This generally leads to people around them being shocked when they go out on a date and overhear Akira calling Mizuki his girlfriend or Mizuki mentioning Akira\'s her boyfriend.\n Air Gear:\n Agito/Akito.\n In chapter 279, while fighting Agito, the girlish loli Shalott reveals to Agito that he is actually a guy.\n In Anatolia Story, Yuri mistakes a guy named Tito for her little sister Eimi. Funny, since Yuri herself is a Bifauxnen.\n In Angel Sanctuary, the only thing Rosiel needed to do to fool mooks into thinking he was a woman was to talk in falsetto.\n In Inoue Kazurou\'s short story Aoi Destruction, the titular father of the main character is a 38 year-old man, yet looks like a little girl.\n Nagisa from Assassination Classroom. He confused many readers into think he\'s a girl. At one point it\'s lampshaded\u2014the class goes swimming, and a couple girls notice he\'s in male swimwear.\n Axis Powers Hetalia:\n Several people thought that China was a girl, him with his ponytail and all. Well, it\'s not that hard to believe with\u25ca pictures\u25ca like\u25ca these.\u25ca It\'s no wonder\u25ca the fans are\u25ca confused\u25ca. Lampshaded by the creator:\nThe only female member of the Allies...not.\n Chibitalia (young North Italy). Many nations, including his caretaker Austria, were convinced he was a girl, and the Holy Roman Empire even fell for him. Until Italy reaches puberty and his voice changes.\n Poland already looks girlish, and then he talks in a schoolgirl dialect (translated to Valley Girl in English) and, when he feels like it, cross-dresses. When they were children, Prussia pointed out that Poland looks like a girl and, because the Teutonic Knights had a vow of chastity, he had to touch his balls...Poland wasn\'t up to it.\n Literally the entire point of Hideyoshi\'s character in Baka and Test. He is thought of as a girl so much, even by his friends that he repeatedly tells he\'s a boy to, that both in-universe and out he is considered his very own gender.\n Hideyoshi: I don\'t want to be alone with girls in the women\'s bath!\n Yuuji: Don\'t worry, Hideyoshi. See?\n Curtain pulls back to reveal bathing area labeled "Hideyoshi"\n Akihisa: So it\'s acknowledged by society.\n Rentaro Taki from Battle Club takes this Up to Eleven, to the point that he literally looks like a woman, complete with relatively large breasts and an attractive feminine figure. Even Word of God states that he\'s a dude in spite of his appearance. The only thing that makes him a male is that he has male genitalia.\n A few characters in Betrayal Knows My Name:\n Most notably Yuki who\'s even told he looks like a girl by other characters. Which is quite understandable as he has been a girl in all of his previous lives.\n And in episode 14, Sodom, once he reveals his human form.\n Black Bird has Kyo, whom Misao mistakes for a pretty girl upon seeing him as an adult.\n Black Butler:\n Finnian. One could easily mistaken him for a girl, especially in the manga.\n Ciel. Joker even had to ask if Ciel was a boy to make sure. Also, in the Green Witch arc Rudgar is surprised to learn that Ciel\'s a boy and Sullivan grabs his crotch while asking "which one" he is.\n Black Lagoon: In the omake episode Boys and Girls (in which everyone is gender-swapped to their opposite genders), Revy (who gender-swapped to male) looks much like his original female version, such as the clothes and hairstyle, which causes Rock (who gender-swapped to female and has gone a bit insane because everyone is gender-swapped and he\'s the only one who remembers their original genders) to believe that Revy is still a woman, but Revy admits to her that he is a guy and proves it by taking off his shorts and showing Rock his genitalia.\n Ryousuke from Bokura no Hentai has long eyelashes and is noted in elementary to have looked like a short haired version of his sister (made even more obvious as family photos reveal Yui herself looked like Ryousuke when she was younger and had Boyish Short Hair). In middle school Ryousuke keeps his hair long to dress up as her.\n Hiromi Sugita from ERASED has both a feminine appearance and name and was allegedly murdered by a serial child kidnapper and killer who targets girls because he was mistaken for one. Satoru later theorizes that the killer was well aware of Hiromi\'s gender and killed him in order to remove himself from the list of suspects, as anyone who knew Hiromi would also know that he\'s a boy and thus be discounted by the police as a serial killer known for targeting young girls. As it turns out, Satoru\'s theory is correct, as the killer is revealed to be both his and Hiromi\'s fifth-grade teacher.\n Mizuki, the main character of Boku Girl, is a guy, but he looks so much like a girl that about everyone has mistaken him for one his whole life. He has even received several love confessions from guys who may or may not be demotivated by his real gender, to his great dismay. To make matters worse, the goddess Loki decides to play a prank on him and turns him into an actual girl!\n It\'s fairly easy to mistake Castle Town Dandelion\'s Haruka for his twin sister. In Chapter 26, Shuu even commented he\'d look fine in a skirt.\n Mumu Momoyama from ChocoMimi gets mistaken for female by both Choco and Mikachin when they meet him. He does occasionally wear skirts, and once dressed as a maid to advertise the class cafe, but he doesn\'t like being mistaken for a girl. Mikachin does assume he\'s a Sweet Polly Oliver once though.\n In Code Geass, Lelouch (in one picture drama he\'s made to look prettier than the girls simply by putting on an Elegant Gothic Lolita dress).\n In Count Cain, the only thing Cain needs to do to convincingly cross-dress is to wear a wig. He managed to fool a man into thinking he was a High-Class Call Girl once, even though the man was literally inches away from his face.\n Gren from Cowboy Bebop. The second he speaks, it\'s obvious he\'s a man, but he looks very feminine and due to an experimental and highly-addictive drug, he has boobs. Big ones.\n Sakuragaoka from D-Frag!. Not only does he look and sound exactly like a girl, but his female clubmember, Tsutsumi Inada, finds him extremely attractive when he crossdresses, often finding any excuse to get him to wear girlish outfits.\n Yu Kanda from D.Gray-Man was mistaken for a girl by Lenalee the first time they met as children. Even now, main character Allen has been known to use "girly face" as an insult for Kanda. In chapter 210 there\'s a scene where a random guy in a bar hits on Kanda, thinking he\'s a girl.\n Daisuke Niwa from D.N.Angel. He was made to dress up as the princess in a play and made a very convincing girl with just a wig and dress. On one occasion, one of his friends comments on how girly he looks.\n Hinata (Hina) Omori of Desire Climax looks just like his beautiful twin sister Mio Omori.\n Seiji Asou from Detective Conan is strong enough in this department that his actual gender was not questioned after being on a Harmless Lady Disguise for two years.\n Rune of Dragon Knights was used as a body double for a princess in the first volume. Later on he gets proposed to by a man who then pats down Rune\'s chest to confirm his claims of masculinity.\n Historical Japanese figure, Nasu no Yoichi, from Drifters is presented this way, to the extent that Toyohisa and Nobunaga both thought he was a girl at first.\n Rei in Fist of the North Star actually takes advantage of this\u2014he disguises himself under a sheet, leaving only his very feminine eyes showing, and then kills the bandits that try to take advantage of him.\n Tokiya Mikagami in Flame of Recca. A death glare awaits those who think he\'s actually a girl in disguise. It\'s even more explicit in the anime than in the manga. When a guy identifies the only teenage boy around as being Fuuko, an enraged Tokiya shouts, "You idiot! I bet you thought I was a girl!"\n In the Free! drama CD, it\'s mentioned that Rin has a pretty face and looks very good in a maid dress. His own sister calls him pretty.\n Several characters in Fruits Basket:\n Ayame is the biggest example. The long white hair doesn\'t help.\n This ambiguity of this trope got played around with. Kakeru started calling Yuki, who gets told he looks like a girl rather often, "ranger pink". He\'s androgynous enough that Kakeru tricked his girlfriend into believing he really was a girl who was cross-dressing as a boy in a Funny Moment.\n Envy from Fullmetal Alchemist, who is male in the first anime series being Hohenhemin and Dante\'s son, but can shapeshift into a woman if he wishes. In the official character book for the manga, the section under Envy is described as "of uncertain gender". He even had a female voice actor in the original Japanese, English, and Hungarian dubs, and this appearance is played for laughs in the Chibi Party OVA.\n Fushigi Yuugi:\n Hotohori is initially mistaken for a woman.\n Likewise Nuriko, though the dress probably guided most assumptions. Even when Nuriko stops wearing dresses and wears more masculine clothing, this trope becomes more apparent for him, especially when he still wears his hair in a long braid.\n Yellow Belmont in Genesis Climber MOSPEADA disguises himself as a female pop singer to avoid detection by the Inbit. His natural appearance is so feminine, however, that in one episode, while sunbathing almost completely naked, he is still mistaken for a woman by a tribal youth seeking a wife.\n When Kazuki of the Strings in Get Backers assists a person in a hospital, not only does the head nurse assume he is a woman, she thinks he is a trainee, makes him wear a nurse\'s uniform, and takes his clothes. Ren also mistakes him for a girl, and is in turn mistaken for a guy by Shido. Amon goes so far as to hit on him. On many occasions, main characters have been peeping on what is supposedly a girl bathing, approached a "girl" from behind, or otherwise been completely blindsided when they see the face and realize that they\'ve been attracted to Kazuki. Major spoilers: the end of the manga reveals that the GB world is an AI simulation with Infinity Tower as its conduit, explaining the superpowers the characters have. In the "real world", Kazuki really is female, and is married to Jubei, bearing his child.\n Yukinari from Girls Bravo. In Season 2, Episode 6 he was made to look like a girl with a wig, a girl\'s outfit, and fake breasts. His disguise was so convincing that even the entire audience and Fukuyama (who hates guys) thought he was a pretty girl. And Fukuyama didn\'t realize Yukinari was actually a boy until after he grabbed his crotch.\n Lucille, the vocalist in the manga Grand Guignol Orchestra, is often mistaken for a woman.\n Ranmaru Fujieda from Haikara San Ga Tooru, being a kabuki artist and also doing acting training.\n Huo Long from Haou Airen.\n Hayate the Combat Butler\'s Hayate Ayasaki has a face girly enough that both Nagi and Maria are occasionally compelled to make him play dress-up for them. The result of those projects sends the Moe factor of the show through the roof.\n Hellsing:\n Alucard\'s apparently female form counts, as despite looking the part, he still retains his deep, obviously male voice.\n Also Schrodinger. It helps that he shares a similar design to Seras (sans the hilariously large bust)\n In Jin, Tanosuke is so feminine, his acting career begun with him playing female characters. If it wasn\'t for his short hair, you probably wouldn\'t guess he\'s a man.\n Miller from Kaguya Hime, much to his dismay.\n Suriou from Kamisama Kiss. Some of the other characters even lampshade it when they remark that he is prettier than the female lead, Nanami.\n Karakuridouji Ultimo:\n Rune. It\'s actually lampshaded; he was a girl in his past lives.\n If you prefer to believe the Doji actually have genders (they are supposed to be robots) then Ultimo, Desir, Jealous, and most especially Sophia and Service all count (the former for his feminine name, and the latter for being a Captain Ersatz of Tamao)\n Pre-Gender Bender Hazumu of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl. Yasuna, who Does Not Like Men, accidentally mistook him for a girl when he was still a "he".\n After Art Evolution, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has suddenly started getting a bunch of them, including the protagonist. Chief offenders include Kikyo and Daisy of the Real Furneral Wreathes. Only in the latest chapter has the translator been certain that Kikyo is male and no one can be certain if Daisy is this or a Bifauxnen.\n Kagemiya Sen from Kekkaishi can be easily mistaken for a female due to his face shape and hairstyle. This is also noted by the other characters in the manga itself, much to Sen\'s displeasure.\n Shun from Kimi to Boku starts out as a Long-Haired Pretty Boy who New Transfer Student Chizuru mistakes for a girl (and falls for). He gets a haircut for the summer and keeps it the rest of the series.\n Shun in Koko Wa Greenwood. As a practical joke, several older residents of the dorm convince the main character (who is Shun\'s roommate) that Shun is in fact a cross-dressing girl. This deception holds until Kazuya runs into Shun using the urinal.\n The titular character of Kunisaki Izumo No Jijou looks like a girl and is often mistaken for one. Because of that, he is also invariably assigned as an onnagatanote\xa0male actor playing female roles in the kabuki plays organised by his family\'s troupe, much to his chagrin.\n Sadachiyo, the Camp Gay assassin from the Lupin III movie Secret of the Twilight Gemini, has a skinny womanly build, a feminine looking face,wears lipstick, has long girly fingernails, and has an effeminate voice, but he\'s also very cruel and sadistic.\n Lord Geppelnitch (or, rather, the human body he\'s possessing) from Macross 7 looks and sounds so ridiculously feminine that nobody among the fans could believe he was a man. Near the end of the series he is seen shirtless, which finally proves it.\n Alto Saotome from Macross Frontier. Well, it generally happened offscreen, but his fine features and long hair make such reports rather believable. The fact that he\'s a trained (and talented!) Kabuki actor, who frequently played female roles, and is a dead-ringer for his gorgeous Missing Mom doesn\'t help either. Frequently addressed as "Princess", at one point he is even offered female clothing by a salesman who mistakes him for a girl. The first time he meets Ranka, she mistakes him for a beautiful woman. And even later describes him to Ozma with that in mind.\nRanka: He was really pretty, like a princess.\n Titus from Magi \x96 Labyrinth of Magic is so girly-looking that Aladdin actually gropes his chest when they first meet in order to make sure Titus is a guy. Turns out there\'s a good reason for his feminine looks since he\'s an Opposite-Sex Clone of a female Magi.\n Narutaru\'s Norio "Nori-rin" Koga has very feminine looks and is often mistaken for a girl.\n Naruto\n Haku looks feminine to the point that the main character is left in shock when he learns that Haku is actually a boy.\nNaruto: No way?! He\'s prettier than Sakura!\n Filler villain Benten in the Shippuden anime. This is to the point where Ch\u016bshin quips that whenever Benten opens his mouth, it looks and sounds strange due to his masculine voice and feminine appearance.\n Upon seeing Sasuke as a baby, Kushina thought he was a girl. He also looks similar to his mom. Itachi even more so. He looks just like his mom and has really long eyelashes.\n In Natsume\'s Book of Friends, Natsume Takashi\'s most defining physical characteristic is his uncanny physical resemblance to his grandmother at that age. While humans don\'t tend to mistake him for the opposite gender (except for that one time where he was possessed by a female Youkai\u25ca and started giving his male friends thoughts), Youkai seem to do it all the time, and according to Madara, the vast majority of Youkai do not make a distinction between genders.\n Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion is essentially a Gender Flip of Nadia (see here\u25ca for notes from Sadamoto himself). He was described by Sadamoto as looking like "a boyish young girl" (more evidence here\u25ca), and was made as such to distinguish him from the mecha heroes at that time. Shinji\'s feminine facial features are brought up by Misato in the first episode, and during the eighth and ninth episodes he\'s made to look like a girl from nothing more than a wardrobe change\u25ca. A scene from the Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 video game had Fuyutsuki say that Shinji looked just like Yui and then crossdress Shinji for the role all while saying how beautiful "she" looks; Fuyutsuki\'s actions soon become overtly sexual. Shinji and Kaworu also make rather pretty girls with little more than a hair and eyelash change (and breasts) in the GenderFlip version of episode 24, longer haired Shinjiko ends up looking like a young version of Yui. The issue is not helped by Maya, who is essentially Shinji in a female officers uniform. And female, obviously.\n Ouran High School Host Club plays with this, in that Haruhi would fall into this perfectly, and does in the eyes of the Host Club\'s customers...except she actually is a girl.\n Patlabor: The Mobile Police: Baddo is a 12 year old boy from India, who looks so feminine that he could be a dead ringer for Nadia; albeit with longer hair. Richard Wong used it to his advantage at the end of the Griffin arc, by disguising Baddo in feminine Indian garb, to cover their escape.\n Peacemaker Kurogane:\n Souji Okita looks eerily like a woman. Other Shinsengumi members lampshade it a few times by reproaching to him that he walks like a woman, acts like a child and is girlishly pretty that he resembles a young girl. That, and he almost never carries a sword around when he\'s off-duty.\n Also, Suzu. Especially after he starts wearing makeup and revealing clothes in the sequel manga. Even the other characters in the series comment on how beautiful he is.\n There\'s also Susumu. He often cross-dresses (quite convincingly) to gather information.\n Pet Shop of Horrors:\n Count D is often mistaken for a woman, to his great annoyance. Probably doesn\'t help that his traditional Chinese clothing looks rather ambiguous.\n Papa D (and Sofu D), being genetic copies of him, look the same. Papa D also has long, flowing hair to make it even better.\n Husky the fishboy from the manga +Anima is so girly in appearance, even the reader isn\'t sure of his gender until he complains about being forced to dress like a girl. When he\'s introduced, he\'s a circus attraction...the "Mermaid Princess". Characters frequently mistake him for a girl, and his friend Nana at one point becomes convinced that he\'s a girl in disguise due to his appearance and the fact that he\'s more girly than she is. Poor Husky is forced to prove his masculinity by getting naked and showing a horrified Nana his manly bits. As it turns out, the reason he doesn\'t care much for girls is because of how much he was teased for looking and acting like one as a boy. A side character even falls in love with him after Husky saved him from drowning...poor guy thought he was, well, the mermaid princess. A group of teenage boys invite him to come "play with them", thinking he\'s a girl. One mentions "she" is a bit young, but apparently the leader "likes [his girls] young". Even after Husky attacks them in rage they don\'t realize he\'s a boy.\n Pok\xe9mon Adventures: Bugsy. Gold got a Bridget dropped on him real quick.\n Gold from Pok\xe9mon Golden Boys mistakes Bugsy for a girl when they first meet.\n Tooru and Yuujirou in Princess Princess frequently get asked out by other guys (when not in their princess garb). The aforementioned two have also stated that when Mikoto is standing next to his girlfriend, they look like two beautiful girls instead of a guy and his girlfriend.\n In Pump Up! the protagonist mistakes a male classmate for a girl. It doesn\'t help that their uniform is androgynous, aside from girls wearing skirts and boys wearing slacks, and he\'s short for a boy. His feminine looks have made him popular with guys too.\n Junior of ROD the TV is pretty enough that one of the Paper Sisters invites him to be their younger sister, so they can all play Little Women together. This...throws him somewhat.\n Kenshin of Rurouni Kenshin, who was based on a real historical figure who used his feminine appearance to his advantage, getting up close to his targets so he could assassinate them and hiding out in brothels after a kill. We see Kenshin doing exactly that in a flashback.\n Saint Seiya:\n Andromeda Shun gets this a lot, even in-universe. His own older brother fell in love with a girl who looked identical to Shun "except for her gender and the color of her hair." It doesn\'t help that his patron constellation is Andromeda the Princess, or that his (pink) armor appears to have been tailored for a woman, complete with breasts in its first form. It even fooled one of the dubbing teams, who cast a female voice actor right up until Ikki first called him "little brother."\n The Gold Saint Aphrodite Pisces, who is obsessed with beauty above all other things. He\'s even named for the Greek goddess of love. Again, this is acknowledged in-universe.\nSeiya: Is he even a man...?\n The Silver Saint Lacerta Misty.\n Samurai Deeper Kyo has Yukimura, a handsome bishonen who is sufficiently androgynous that he can easily pass for a woman in the right clothes, and has a FEMALE ninja as his body double. Not a macho-looking female ninja either.\n Shugo Chara!:\n Nagihiko, otherwise known as Nadeshiko. Yup, that Nadeshiko. This is a guy, believe it or not.\u25ca\n Tadase Hotori, too.\n Wapourif from Simoun. The people of his world are female until they turn 17, at which point they choose their adult gender, but the change isn\'t immediate. Wapourif hasn\'t been a man long enough for his big breasts to flatten out, and still wears his hair long. One could easily be forgiven for thinking he was a Wrench Wench.\n The World is Still Beautiful\'s Bardouin, thanks to his long hair and bishonen looks. Livius lampshades this in an argument, saying he should just look in the mirror if he wants to go after pretty girls. Bardouin doesn\'t react well to that comment.\n Zaji of Tegami Bachi has garnered more than few double-takes for his androgynous appearance.\n The Five Star Stories\' Amaterasu dis Grand Grees Eydas IV and his sort-of honorary nephew Maximum HOLTFORS Ballanche Kaien, Duke of Fates. The guys could win any androgyny contest just by showing up, and surprising unsuspecting males is a Running Gag for Amaterasu when he goes to fool around incognito. Hell, there was a moment when Amaterasu was impersonated by a full-on woman, and nobody noticed.\n Kogure, from The Secret Devil-chan.\n Tokyo Ghoul: Suzuya and Sasaki make quite the attractive ladies merely by changing into feminine attire and Sasaki wearing a wig. Tsukiyama occasionally crosses into this in the sequel when he\'s in his Angst Coma showing him to be even more beautiful and frail than usual. Kanae was initially this before  he was revealed to actually be a woman.\n Tono to Issho: Motochika, to the extent that he\'s voiced by Mamiko Noto and his retainers refuse to accept he\'s a boy, making him wear a miniskirt and fantasizing about marrying him.\n Loran Cehack from Turn A Gundam is effeminate enough that, in masculine clothing, Guin Lineford called him "Laura" (also used by the Earth Militia and Dianna Counter when referring to him). He also cross-dresses rather convincingly. Lineford himself lampshades the name, saying it suits Loran better. It\'s turned into an important plot element as the enemy (and most of the militia) are convinced the "White Doll\'s" pilot is female. Rumor has it that Loran\'s design was Tomino\'s Writer Revolt against the execs not letting him have a female main character.\n Played with in UQ Holder!. The supposedly-male Kuromaru is extremely girly and gets mistaken for a girl and called "miss" by about every other character. In fact, it\'s left ambiguous for some time whether Kuromaru is just a really feminine male or a biological female who identifies as male. However, while Kuromaru isn\'t lying when claiming not to be a girl, "he" is not actually a "dude" either. Turns out Kuromaru has No Biological Sex: the particular breed of demons he is descended from do not become male or female until 16 years of age, at which point they make a conscious decision which to become. Kuromaru is currently leaning towards male (hence why he identifies as such), but hasn\'t reached that age yet. To make things more complicated, Kuromaru is beginning to think about becoming female, due to developing a crush on the male main character.\n Hibiki Tokai from Vandread was mistaken for a young girl once by another man.\n Canute in Vinland Saga is initially mistaken for a girl once he removes the helm hiding his face, and though the confusion gets cleared up fairly quickly, Thorfinn continues to use the insulting nickname "Princess" for a bit, and Thorkell\'s men once make a crack that if Thorkell is the avatar of Thor, Canute must be the avatar of Freya.\n Shingo in the King of Brutes storyline in Violence Jack. And, because this is Violence Jack, he is molested because of this. MANY. TIMES.\n Waratte! Sotomura-san: In a flashback from when the Sotomura siblings went to a store to buy yukatas, each one was given something for the other\'s gender.\n Yoon in Yona of the Dawn is frequently mistaken for a girl. This actually helps him to infiltrate a human trafficking ring, disguised as a girl. Hilariously, this is averted with the rest of the Dragons who despite being Bishounen aren\'t able to pull off that feminine look.\n Oddly enough, the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX dub makes several jokes about this in the case of Professor Chronos/Crowler:\n"I didn\'t know he was a doctor." \u2014>"I didn\'t know he was even a dude."\n Kurama from YuYu Hakusho. In the last episode, some girls in a train station mistake him for Kuwabara\'s girlfriend (which seems strange, since he is quite tall, flat-chested and broad-shouldered). This is even funnier in the manga, due to the fact that Kurama briefly starts to lose his temper. When Yusuke later asks him to help nab a monster at a girls\' school, he bitterly asks, "Should I wear a disguise, or shouldn\'t I bother?"\n Ranewater Calder from Zombiepowder.. It didn\'t help that he\'s the leader of a gang called the "Ash Daughter Gang"...\n Frequently done in Kaori Yuki manga, not just in terms of art, but as part of the storyline.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comic Books\xa0\n Korbinian ("Bini") from Mingamanga is a Heavy Metal fan and has the hair.

The mistreatment is still wrong, but the mistake embarrasses the "girl"\u2014it\'s  Scott. Ruth later makes the same mistake and Alex teases him until he gives himself an Important Haircut.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Film\u2014Animation\xa0\n This is Francis the male ladybug\'s shtick in A Bug\'s Life. He has a very feminine face as well as a very masculine voice. This is lampshaded a couple of times; for example, when we first meet him, two bugs in the audience start hitting on him when he performs. Helps that he\'s voiced by Denis Leary!\nFrancis: So, being a ladybug automatically makes me a girl! Is that it, flyboy?! Eh?! Flies: Cripes, she\'s a guy!\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Film\u2014Live-Action\xa0\n Angelica in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides poses as Jack because he was the only (male) pirate she thought she could pass for.\n Tobio in Wild Zero (although he might be a Wholesome Crossdresser).\n In the movie of Hair, the hippies crash a party and one of the partygoers comments on the "Negro with the two young ladies" (there was only one girl in the group; the "second" was presumably Woof, who has long blonde hair and is clean-shaven).\n The \'60s comedy What\'s New Pussycat? opens with Peter Sellers in a velvet suit and shoulder-length hair, arguing with his wife, who accuses him of seeing another woman. She demands "Is she prettier than me?" He shouts "Is she prettier than you?!...I\'m prettier than you!" (Note: for comparison\'s sake, he\'s nowhere near pretty.)\n Inverted in the film version of Dark Shadows. During the party at Collinwood, Barnabas mentions that Alice Cooper is the ugliest woman he\'s ever seen, not realizing that he was looking at a man. (He was confused by the name.)\n A Flirt\'s Mistake (1914). Fatty Arbuckle and other men are enticed by a passing creature wearing high heels, a flowing gown, and shoulder-length hair. Then he sees the person\'s front, and discovers the person is actually a bearded rajah. Who does not appreciate the attention.\n There is an instance used in The Case Of The Mukkinese Battle Horn first heard in the radio program The Goon Show, in which Peter Sellers (in the short film, Harry Secombe in the radio show) is noticeably aroused by the veiled belly dancer in a seedy club who goes over to him and after calling "her" a beautiful creature, etc., he asks what causes "\'her\' to dance in such a den of sin?" "She" lifts her veil, revealing "her" to be Eccles (played by Spike Milligan), with the line "I\'ve got to make a living, too, you know!"\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Jokes\xa0\n A cabbie picks up a nun. She gets into the cab, and the cab driver won\'t stop staring at her. She asks him why he is staring. He replies, "I have a question to ask you, but I don\'t want to offend you." She answers, "My son, you cannot offend me. When you\'re as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I\'m sure that there\'s nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive." "Well, I\'ve always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me." She responds, "Well, let\'s see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be single and #2, you must be Catholic." The cab driver is very excited and says, "Yes, I am single; and I \'m Catholic too!" "OK" the nun says. "Pull into the next alley." He does, and the nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. "My dear child," said the nun, "why are you crying?" "Forgive me, Sister, but I have sinned. I lied. I must confess, I\'m married and I\'m Jewish." The nun says, "That\'s OK, my name is Gary and I\'m on my way to a Halloween party."\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Light Novels\xa0\n Sword Art Online, due to the random generation of the avatar, Kirito, who already looks rather feminine ends up with this appearance while in GGO. As if he didn\'t have enough problems already (what with a guy running around doing real PKs), he now has to go around looking like Snow White!\n Hideyoshi from Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts. He has to keep reminding Akihisa (and everyone else) that he\'s actually a guy, and is at one point mistaken for his twin sister. This has gotten to the point that a) Hideyoshi being a third gender is a Running Gag, and b) Hideyoshi gets most of the Fanservice shots of the series...in what would be extremely potent female fanservice moments/poses, if not for Hideyoshi being, er, not female. Stupid Sexy Flanders ensues.\n Yuuta of Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions looks quite feminine according to a few characters and, in the light novels, himself.\nIsshiki: Hmm, it\xef\xbf\xbds disappointing! Why weren\'t you born as a girl?! Ah, but maybe you\'ll do if we put you in female clothing...how about it?\n Kazumi in Gargoyle of the Yoshinagas. That he looks like a girl is one of the things his little sister teases him about to no end. Still, he\'s generally a nice guy and even has a girl that has a crush on him.\n Huey Laforet from Baccano!. One character (Tick\'s younger brother) had to guess at his gender based on his voice\u2014and, even then, he wasn\'t really sure. Firo also skirts the trope a bit. Nobody\'s ever mistaken him for a woman, but cops and FBI members have a habit of taking jabs at his appearance, like insinuating that he only got promoted to Capo because he was pretty enough to sleep his way up the ranks.\n A lot of guys from Saiunkoku Monogatari, but especially Sa Sakujun, with his long pink hair.\n In the manga, Ko Kijin wins a men-in-drag contest basically by showing up.\n Nakameguro from Seitokai no Ichizon. It\'s enough to instill some Stupid Sexy Flanders moments in Ken in episode 12.\n In A Certain Magical Index, Last Order asked Accelerator if he was a boy or a girl because she couldn\'t tell.\n If Her Flag Breaks: Due to his very feminine appearance and attire (thigh-high socks and shorts), Megumu is mistaken for a girl by many characters when they first meet him. The fact that he wears the male uniform (or, at least, the male blazer) is the only way anyone could see that he was actually a boy.\n No6:\n Nezumi. He makes a living performing in Shakespeare plays. In episode 5, he was playing a girl. In episode 1, Shion even states that he looks like a girl.\n Inukashi (Dogkeeper), if you go with the theory that (s)he\'s a guy. The manga, anime, and light novels support varying interpretations of his/her gender, and it\'s never stated outright. Either way, (s)he\'s got really long hair from never cutting it and a thin build from malnutrition.\n Shion. He\'s Bish\u014dnen, has a face similar to Safu\'s (who\'s a girl), and in chapter 6, a guy hits on him and tells him that he\'s "very pretty".\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Most males in the Anita Blake series fit this trope except for Richard and a couple of others. Most of them are swooningly subservient, have feminine faces, slender bodies and long flowing hair.\n The Fool in Robin Hobb\'s works. He even spends a few years passing as a woman, and for most of the series the Fool\'s exact gender is unknown, until the final book of The Tawny Man series, where it is revealed that the Fool is actually male.\n Well, hir belongs to a non-human species and some of hir physical attributes are continually changing (skin and hair colour). It is entirely possible that zee physically changes hir sex in intervals (it seemed more like zee was genuinely thinking of hirself as female-gendered for a time, not just pretending), or that hir physical sex wasn\'t determined until the last trilogy, considering zee was still adolescent before that.\n Lani Garver, from What Happened To Lani Garver. In fact, although the narrator finally just refers to Lani in the masculine form, the issue is never actually resolved.\n There\'s an entire species of these in Alan Dean Foster\'s Taken trilogy. When they talk, however, they sound like garbage disposals, as fits their combination of an absolute sense of honor and a fondness for killing.\n Nakajima, protagonist of the Digital Devil Story series, is described as handsome in a feminine way. Specifically used as a taunt at one point.\n Seregil unintentionally manages to have a very straight man fall in love/lust with him using only a very modest dress, a little make-up, and his acting skills. (He already has a slim body, long hair, and apparently no facial hair growth.) He spent many days in that disguise surrounded by the same people on a cramped ship, and nobody noticed. His apprentice also developed a bit of a crush on him, and later unconsciously chooses a female prostitute who looked like Seregil in drag. Of course, later it turns out that the kid is bisexual and just hadn\'t realized it yet.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n Vince Noir of The Mighty Boosh is mistaken for a woman (or more specifically, as his friend Howard\'s wife or girlfriend) in nearly every episode. He addresses his oddly compelling androgyny himself in the episode "Party": "Of course you [fancy me] \u2014 all men do! I\'m the confuser! \'Is it a man? Is it a woman? I\'m not sure if I mind!\'"\n Dennis Finch in Just Shoot Me!, though he is more often confused for being gay.\n The CSI episode "What\'s Eating Gilbert Grissom?" features a guy killed after he is mistaken for the female victim the murderer had already picked out. The murderer did have vision problems though, due to bad laser surgery, but not confusing your victims is Serial Killer 101.\n An episode of the German police procedural Tatort had a short scene from a rapist\'s point of view while he was looking for a new victim. The camera lengthily gazed over several longhaired beauties, among them one which caused the POV to rapidly shift to another when he turned around.\n Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! had a whole song about a man whose footsteps sounded like those of a woman.\n An episode of Mad About You had Paul and his cousin first mistaking an obese "woman" as pregnant - and when correcting for that mistake, discovering it was a man. After it was solved, they call the waiter who asks "And the lady?".\n While Kurt from Glee doesn\'t look like a girl per se (though he\'s Bish\u014dnen enough that him doing drag isn\'t hard to picture), he certainly sounds like one: the second thing he usually has to say when answering the phone is "No, she\'s dead, this is her son." It\'s been lampshaded a bit, like like Sue calling him "lady face" and when the mean jocks in theatricality mentioned that they couldn\'t tell the difference between him and girls.\n Chappelle\'s Show: During Charlie Murphy\'s True Hollywood Stories skit about Prince, Charlie Murphy remarks how Mickey Free, a member of Prince\'s crew, looked like a girl.\nWhen he joined the group, I heard mad cats like, "Yo, Shalamar got a new girl in there, man, bitch fine like a motherfucker." They was talking about Mickey Free, man, okay? Mickey Free is not a girl."\n Noah\'s Arc: Even aside from the effeminate clothes, Romeo\'s physical features are remarkably feminine.\n 2 Broke Girls: Han remarks in one episode that a Camp Gay couple asked him if he was a "rice queen on the downlow"\nEarl: They think he\'s gay!\nMax: Huh... (beat) That\'s a step up; usually people think he\'s a lesbian.\n It happens again in "And the Pearl Necklace":\nSophie: Where\'s that Asian lady who usually brings me my menu?\nCaroline: That\'s Han ... Han\'s a man.\nSophie: If you say so ...\n In the Bones episode "The Girl in the Mask", a doctor flies in from Japan to aid with the investigation and the team spends most of the episode trying to figure out his/her gender. Angela divines at the end of the episode through a very thorough hug that he/she is a man, despite the fact that the character was played by a woman.\n In 30 Rock:\nBucky Bright: I wandered the building all night. I didn\'t run into another single living soul. Except one giant lesbian. Who is Conan O\'Brien, and why is she so sad?\n On That \'70s Show, Jackie uses makeup to glam up Kelso like David Bowie. She\'s delighted with the results and chirps "You\'re prettier than Bowie!" He\'s pleased with the results and chirps "I\'m prettier than you!"\n Referenced in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. when the Asgardian woman Lorelei sees a $100 bill for the first time and thinks that Benjamin Franklin is a woman.\n On an episode of The Benny Hill Show, Benny is in a bar and attempts to pick up what he thinks is a long-haired woman. Benny approaches her and says "My wife doesn\'t understand me." The "woman" turns around, showing herself to be a long-haired man, and says "Neither does mine!"\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Professional Wrestling\xa0\n "He looks more like a woman than a man" was one of the reasons Kurt Angle gave for disliking Jeff Hardy, while Hardy was the centerpiece of Immortal and made a silver Aztec sun belt styled after his face.\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Religion and Mythology\xa0\n In Greek Mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection. Some say that he mistook it for a beautiful woman, while others say that he recognized himself. He was then turned into a flower that bears his name. This happened because he spurned the affections of a young man named Ameinias and a (female) nymph named Echo, who prayed to Nemesis for revenge.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theatre\xa0\n In Jerusalem, Ginger is mistaken for a woman by the Professor, though this is only because the former has long hair and the latter is a senile and possibly crazy old man. Nobody else has any doubts about Ginger\'s sex, which makes sense given that Mackensie Crook doesn\'t look much like a woman at all.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n Bridget from Disgaea 2. Just like every other human in the game, he was cursed with the appearance of a demon. Of course, in his case, the aforementioned demon form is that of a very feminine Nymph-like creature. Unsettling Gender Reveals ensue.\n Fierro of Eternal Eden fell in love with Jean despite Jean telling him that he\'s a man.\n Fire Emblem has a couple of these. The first one seen by Westerners was Lucius\u25ca from the seventh game, Blazing Sword. He\'s even mistaken to be a woman by Serra in-game.\n Libra from Fire Emblem Awakening gets mistaken for a woman by practically everyone who talks to him, due to not only looking but sounding very feminine. So much that some of them occasionally forget that he\'s a man, even after he points it out to them.\n Elphin from Binding Blade, like Lucius, gets mistaken as a girl, this time in his A support with Fae, who corrects her almost immediately.\n Forrest from Fire Emblem Fates continues the trend. While not as feminine sounding as Libra, he sure makes up for it by being a Wholesome Crossdresser who is very good at sewing. Not to mention his father\'s initial embarrassment of that lifestyle.\n Raiden, from Metal Gear Solid 2. Like Rune, he got patted down, but in... er, a different area. By the US President. It doesn\'t help that we\'re so used to visual representation of the male body as having no hips (they do, just not as pronounced as women) that Raiden is relentlessly mocked because of the figure-enhancing suit he wears. ("Hips Don\'t Lie" is a minor meme for male character models that look like they\'re just very flat women.)\n Then there\'s Raikov, from the follow up game Metal Gear Solid 3. Raikov was created in response to the controversy surrounding Raiden following his replacement of Solid Snake as the main character. Hideo Kojima on more than one occasion has commented on Raikov\'s beautiful looks.\n As in other games, Pok\xe9mon Conquest portrays Ranmaru in this way, to the point where he ends up participating in an otherwise female-only tournament.\n Mitsunari is also portrayed this way.\n Not to mention some Pokemon themselves. Lopunny, Gardevoir, Aromatisse, Gothitelle/Gothorita and a few more all look feminine even though they can be male. Gardevoir is particularly notable for this because Kirlia has two evolutions. The male-looking Gallade can evolve only from a male Kirlia via Dawn Stone, but the very feminine-looking Gardevoir can evolve indiscriminately from a male or female Kirlia through leveling.\n Felix in Radiata Stories. He has a male stalker who is shocked and appalled when it is revealed that Felix is male - yet continues to stalk him anyway.\n Ranmaru Mori of the Samurai Warriors series has a very feminine appearance, to the point that he gets mistaken for a woman in universe to the point of Running Gag status\u2014he even "counts" as a lady for the purposes of Designated Girl Fights. Amusingly, one of his battlecries from Warriors Orochi is "I\'m as dangerous as I am manly!"\n Also, Ne Zha from the same game. The child-like face and pink hair doesn\'t seem to help much on his case.\n Parodied in the comics for Team Fortress 2. Merasmus the magician constantly gets referred to as "ma\'am" and "witch-woman" despite clearly looking and sounding like a man.\n In World of Warcraft, blood elf males invoke this trope frequently. One post-Cataclysm quest, for instance, features a parody of a Knight Errant looking for damsels in distress. One of said damsels is a male blood elf, who dropped his "purse"...um "crate" in the lake.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Visual Novels\xa0\n  CLANNAD: Kappei Hiiragi. Sunohara is still in denial, despite the fact that Tomoya told him that he had been fooled. The implications are not lost.\n Hideaki Hakamichi, Shizune\'s little brother from Katawa Shoujo. His dad seems about as sympathetic to his plight as he is to Shizune\'s deafness.\n Mizuho of Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru is very pretty even when not cross-dressing as a girl.\n Ruka (sometimes called Rukako) from Steins;Gate is incredibly effeminate and frequently cross-dresses to complete the illusion. Lampshaded by Rintaro when Ruka is introduced; he makes a series of flattering descriptive statements, followed by "but he\'s a dude".\nRintaro: [narrating] Ruka: the embodiment of feminine grace and charm...also a total dude...\n Chiharu, one of the minor characters in They Are My Noble Masters. Besides being frequently ignored (even more than Yume, who\'s already barely noticed by the other characters), Ren has to have his gender confirmed the first time they meet.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Webcomics\xa0\n Jacob the Rag doll from Monsterful, his long hair and shy personality make it even worse.\n Tedd of El Goonish Shive, whenever he removes his Opaque Nerd Glasses. And even when he doesn\'t, "he\'s just that androgynous" is the oldest Running Gag of EGS.\n Certain habits of his don\'t help matters, though it\'s suggested that one of the reasons he does it is when he\'s a boy, his feminine face gets him mocked. When he\'s a girl, he\'s a hottie.\n Noah is even worse. Elliot\'s reaction when meeting him is "Who\'s this...guy? I think?"\n At one point, he magically dyed his hair pink and went to a Magic: The Gathering tournament. This drew attention from straight men at the tournament, although he seems to be under the assumption that anyone attracted to him is gay.\n Dan in Dan and Mab\'s Furry Adventures  with his long hair, fluffy wings, and robe, gets mistaken for a woman all the time. Sometimes he hates it, but sometimes he uses it to his advantage...\n Penny Arcade had a running gag where Gabe kept mistaking game developer John Romero for a woman (despite Tycho\'s repeated corrections) because of his "long, flowing hair".\n They both made this mistake at least once.\n Parodied in Insecticomics when Moral Guardian Lady Jaye attempts to make the \'naked\' robots all wear censor bars. Override, who is female but has a gender-neutral body, taunts Lady Jaye by asking how many censor bars she needs. Lady Jaye eventually puts a censor bar on her groin but not on her chest, having decided that Override is male.\n Leslie from Flaky Pastry has an ambiguous name, dresses androgynously, works as a barmaid (complete with skirt and tube top) and is surprised when the girl he asks out thinks he is gay.\n In this Sidekick Girl strip, Chris looks like a tall, skinny girl, but in the next strip is revealed to be a young man with very long hair.\n This Sluggy Freelance strip invokes this trope thanks to an alien race where the males look an awful lot like human females. Rather than being grossed out that they were drooling over a guy, Torg and Riff keep right on staring at his breasts. "Could you jump up and down for us, mister?"\n Cale from Looking for Group is often referred to as "she" by Richard when the latter is still getting to know him, even after he\'s well aware that Cale is male. Aside from Richard\'s mocking, Cale\'s effeminate appearance continues to be used as a Running Gag with other characters as well.\n My Life In Blue: "Your mom looks like a girl. Ooo."\n In Gold Coin Comics, Theo, whose job class (healer) is normally reserved for girls, is mistaken for a woman when Lance first meets him.\n Faux Pas: Randy, who is male, once was Miss April on a calendar.\n Heart Of Keol has Danbi, who not only looks like a girl, but also practices an art traditionally reserved for women in his culture. His sexually ambiguous voice (caused by throat damage) doesn\'t help.\n Kano, the main character of Kagerou. The artist has made specific note of his "absurd girl hair".\n Eutropia of Amazoness\u2014it\'s actually a plot point.\n Chovek, a minor character in Inhuman. The fact that he\'s pink doesn\'t help.\n Lampshaded heavily and hilariously in Chasing the Sunset, as Leaf is so girly that it often takes ages for someone meeting him to realize he\'s a guy. But then, he\'s an elf, so bishiness is pretty much par for the course.\n The Order of the Stick\'s Vaarsuvius. Maybe.\n Given the art style, pretty much everyone is of Ambiguous Gender and we have to rely on clothing and how they\'re referred to by other characters to tell. V wears a wizard robe, so that\'s no help, and the other characters aren\'t any better since most of them have no idea what gender V is either.\n In spite of being an adult male well into adulthood, Vinci of Vinci and Arty is often mistaken for being a female, at one point being mistaken for a pregnant woman in labor when pulled over by a cop. It Makes Sense in Context.\n He often combines it with Older Than They Look, too. How about being mistaken for a little girl?\n Meet Dubious Company\'s Elator. Later on, a drunk Tiren braids his hair with magic hair ties that won\'t undo. Most characters mistake him for female. Marty has problems with this revelation.\n Unwinder\'s Tall Comics: Dr. Minivan, after losing his hair (for science), buys a wig to hide his baldness. The wig is so long that he gets mistaken for a woman. When this happens in a public restroom, he panics and hides in a stall, and tries to figure out how to get back out of the restroom without incurring further confusion. This takes so long that he grows a beard. Problem solved!\n Sunstone has Alan, who is so protective of what facial hair he has not even his wedding day could part him from it. Some of the characters have a vendetta to get the man to cross dress.\n Allen from Allen The Alien, who would\'t normally be this trope, is mistaken by the aliens for a girl; RR-TWTTW somehow think he resembles his daughter.\n Life has Edward\'s roommate Lex.\nLex: And yes, I am a guy.\n Lampshaded in MMBN 7 The World Tournament, were Sean mistakes Viddy Narcy as a woman at first before their match.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n Izael from the The Gamer\'s Alliance is often confused for a girl because of his looks.\n Axel from Demyx Time enjoys mocking Marluxia for this. Inverted when Demyx firmly believes that Larxene is a man.\n In the Dissidia: Final Fantasy machinima "Real Men", there\'s a segment where Squall states, "Only a real man hangs out with the ladies." Cloud responds with, "You know that\'s a guy, right?" but Squall firmly states that it\'s a chick, until he finally decides to ask the man/lady in question, who is Bartz. Bartz replies, "Oh yes, I am male\u2014I mean, FE-male." Squall\'s response?\nSquall: ...Oh, you\'re dead... [gunclick]\n Phase, in the Whateley Universe, looks and sounds so girly that he\'s given up and dresses in mannish girl\'s clothes that fit him, while he tries to find a way to change himself back to a manly guy. Even in pants and heavy coat, he still gets tabbed as a girl, much to his disgust.\n Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series parodies this trend in Yu-Gi-Oh!:\nMarik: Foolish fools! There are no women in Yu-Gi-Oh!, only extremely girly men! And I am the girliest of them all!\nPegasus: Keep telling yourself that.\n Marik and Bakura are frequently mistaken for a woman. Duke and Yami are very pretty like women as well.\n Equestria Chronicles has Shiloh, who looks like a filly and has been mistaken for one on multiple occasions.\n Equestrian Legends: Beret Swirl invokes this trope to get free drinks.\n In the Roleplay wiki, one of the character profiles done is of an Androgynous ninja.\n And while we\'re still talking about ponies, 4chan\'s original character "Golden Brisk", who is CONSTANTLY mistaken for a female to his own chagrin, to the point that his day job is to model women\'s clothing. He spends most of his free time trying to make himself look "manlier" and failing hilariously. His love interest is his own Distaff Counterpart Silver Breeze.\n In Death Note The Abridged Series KPTS 4 TV in Da Chief\'s warped perceptions, Ryuk is a trap. Upon meeting him, Da Chief declares "goth girls are hot!" Also, upon first meeting Light, Ryuk mistakes him for a girl:\nRyuk: Tell you what--I need a place to stay. If you let me bunk with you maybe we can experiment together. W\u2014with the Death Note. Not each other. You\'re a sick little girl, you know that?!\nLight: But I\'m a boy!\nRyuk: Riiight.\n Gaia Online\'s Gino Gambino at one point looked very feminine despite the memetic "Twinkie Brows"; the description for his collectible doll states that he\'s often mistaken for a girl. More recent manga updates featuring him have been making him a little more masculine, via Art Evolution and an Important Haircut.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Edd from Ed, Edd \'n\' Eddy can be seen as this. In fact, in the series finale, "Big Picture Show", Eddy\'s brother mistakes him for Eddy\'s girlfriend.\n Home Movies: Brendon comes home to find his mom and her boss looped on wine. On seeing him the boss shouts "Well, look at you! What a perfectly adorable little young lady!". Brendon anxiously replies "Ah...well...I\'m not so little...". Brendon is considered to be kind of girly by lots of folks, including his friends.\n In an episode of Johnny Bravo, Johnny is at the beach when he approaches what appears to a woman in a bikini, but as soon as the person turns around, it turns out to be a slender man with long hair in a speedo.\nJohnny: Whoa! I thought you were a chick!\n On The Legend of Korra, Korra\'s creepy Half Identical Twin cousins Desna and Eska are introduced, and since they look exactly alike except for make-up on Eska (the girl), Bolin assumes they are both girls.\n Many viewers of "Littlest Pet Shop (2012)" thought that Sweet Cheeks the Sugar Glider from the episode "Pawlm Reading" was female, especially given he had a squeaky high voice and long eyelashes, when in fact he\'s male.\n Princess Stori from "Terriers and Tiaras". Zoe is quite shocked upon learning this the first time he speaks.\n Metalocalypse: Skwisgaar Skwigelf is tall and thin, with long hair, large lips and very nice butt. He does not like it when you call him a lady.\nSkwisgaar: [puts a box of tampons inside Toki\'s shopping cart, chucking to himself] Uhhh, hey Toki, look inside of your basket. Guess why you are is in such a crappy mood. You have ladies\' tampons. Inside of it. And you buy them for yourself. Go have a conversation with all the ladies and tell them your problems! Toki: You lady, Skwisgaar! Skwisgaar: NO IS NOT!\n Seabreeze from the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic episode "It Ain\'t Easy Being Breezies". The combo of pink hair, eyelashes, and the fact that the rounded muzzle is typically a trait of female ponies makes him look rather girly.\n The main joke of SheZow is the fact that the title character is a guy who has to dress like a girl due to the ring that gives him his powers. A Title Drop of the tropes is done in the first episode.\n On an early (as in before it was cancelled and Un-Cancelled) episode of Family Guy, the gang are discussing which celebrities they would have sex with if they had the chance. Quagmire says Taylor Hanson, and suffers a minor breakdown once he\'s told Hanson is a man.\nQuagmire: But I have all these magazines! ...Oh God!\n Another episode had Quagmire being asked which celebrity he\'d have sex with, and was given a choice between two men. He chooses Johnny Depp, because "he kind of looks like a chick, I guess".\n\n\nIt\'s a trap!\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/DudeLooksLikeDubiousContent_680.png', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Adekan', u'titleofwork': u'Adekan'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AKB49RenaiKinshiJourei', u'titleofwork': u'AKB49 - Renai Kinshi Jourei'}, {u'genre': u'Anime & Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiOreLoveMe', u'titleofwork': u'Ai Ore!

I may be old but at least I\'m not like all those other old guys."\n\u2014 Five Iron Frenzy, "At Least I\'m Not Like All Those Other Old Guys"\nThe effectiveness of a cast member is often determined by his distance from the median age of the cast. Deviations up or down will always be coupled with a lack of effectiveness. The Cool Old Guy is an exception to this. At some point, if one character is much older he swings the meter back to \'totally awesome\'. In a lot of anime and video games, this makes him somewhere around middle age and the only non-clean shaven guy. Expect him to be greying, a loud voice, but in peak physical condition and unafraid of anything. For reasons that should be clear enough, this trope frequently overlaps with Bald of Awesome.\nHe usually won\'t have any special powers but that\'s only to marginally keep him from intruding on the others\' limelight. He usually either has a dated and dramatic but lovable personality or is a complete no-nonsense hardass, depending on how the other characters act.\nIn Japan, this trope is called the Oyaji, written \u89aa\u7236 or \u30aa\u30e4\u30b8, which means "daddy". Can often stray into Even the Guys Want Him or Stupid Sexy Flanders territory. Wise Beyond Their Years is a younger version (usually no younger than late 20s at minimum) that has many of the same characteristics.\nSee also: Old Master, Older Sidekick, Badass Grandpa, Eccentric Mentor, The Obi-Wan, Dirty Old Man, Evil Old Folks, Token Adult. See Cool Old Lady for the Distaff Counterpart. Contrast Grumpy Old Man.\n\nExamples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Advertising\xa0\n Fred the Baker from the Dunkin Donuts commercials, from 1981 to 1997. (As in "Time to make the donuts!") Originally portrayed as an atypical baker, a hard-working, average joe who always got up early so his product could be ready and fresh for his customers, Fred got progressively cooler as the years went on, doing such things as dressing up like a woman to investigate a supermarket bakery (to show their inferiority), waiting on modish 1980s customers while going into a black and white kitchen full of 1940s employees working to swing music (to show that quality has not changed throughout the years) or even creating his Halloween-themed mini donuts Mad Scientist-style.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime & Manga\xa0\n No Fukumoto series is complete without one- a lot of the time they\'re complete nutjobs too though. Just to name a few, Ichikawa in Akagi, Ginji in Gin to Kin and Akagi in Ten.\n Bear from .hack//SIGN was an older man comfortably pals with a teenage girl, Mimiru, through their shared love of virtual reality online gaming.\n Phyllo in Roots. He sits on the bridge in Mac Anu all day, talking to anyone who\'s interested and becoming close with Haseo. In real life he\'s an old man, widowed and with two cats. As he tells Haseo, he\'s just there to kill time, and dies of cancer at the end of the anime.\n 20th Century Boys loves its Cool Old Guys.\n Since it starts its characters around ten and takes them up to a prematurely-aged forty-something, yeah.  Later-appearing Kenji is pretty good with this, especially considering his scruffy chin, but last-stage Shogun wins. A lot.\n Yukiatsu in Ayakashi Ayashi (Ghost Slayers Ayashi), a special case, since he\'s also the protagonist.\n The protagonist\'s grandfather in Beyblade may be getting up there in age - but that\'s not gonna stop him from dancing on the tables in Vegas!\n Scary Black Man Dutch from Black Lagoon. Given that he\'s a Vietnam vet, and roughly contemporary setting of the show, he must be at least in his fifties.\n Apparently, he lied about being a Vietnam vet. Who knows how old he really is...\n Bleach: Old Man Genocide Yamamoto is the Badass Grandpa of the series and the kind of cool old guy that could turn you into a charcoal biscuit if you disagreed.\n Master Tiellagory of Le Chevalier d\'Eon is one of the best fencers in France and possibly all of Europe, as well as having more experience with court parties and often wittier repartee than his younger companions.\n Jet from Cowboy Bebop (although almost all of the main characters are hardened ultra-cool characters).\nJet: Wait a minute! First of all, I\'m not old enough to be your father, all right? Why, if anything, I would be your boyfriend...note\xa0Jet\'s 36, and the girl he\'s having the current conversation with is around 16. No, wait, that would be bad, wouldn\'t it? Open foot, insert mouth. I mean, I\'d be more like your older brother...\n Kanchou/Skipper from The Daughter of Twenty Faces certainly fits this trope to a t; even his death is cool. An argument could also be made for Muta, even though he\'s more The Stoic.\n Watari, acting as L\'s assistant, proxy and Battle Butler in Death Note.\n Early on in Dragon Ball Master Roshi filled this role, even defeating the main character Goku at the end of the series\'s first tournament arc, where he actually blew up the frickin\' moon! Unfortunately, Roshi\'s power level remained fairly constant throughout the series, while the younger characters became vastly stronger every arc, to the point where, by the start of Dragon Ball Z Roshi was relegated to being the comic relief.\n Axel Thurston, grandfather of Renton Thurston in Eureka Seven. Robot mechanic extraordinaire and full of determination, even if a bit grumpy. Not to mention that he does a near-suicidal stunt to make possible for Renton to get an indispensable device and lives through it.\n Alan Nichol in Freedom Project. Alan is a retired astronaut who essentially plays Master Splinter to a group of societal dropouts, helps them supercharge their racing vehicles, and even gets them into space.\n Fullmetal Alchemist:\n Lt General Grumman, Old Man Fu and Dr Knox.\n Fuhrer King Bradley  aka Wrath, who despite being at least 60 and regularly complaining about feeling his age is one of the most badass characters in the Fullmetal Alchemist universe.\n Full Metal Panic! has Andrey Kalinin, who admittedly plays mostly a support role, but is still a tough old soldier who still has some fight in him, made especially obvious during the Behemoth arc.\n Gauron could be considered this. His Ax-Crazy, nutty ways and apparent immortality have made certain parts of the fandom feel that he\'s completely awesome.\n Gangsta features Chad the police officer and Monroe the mafioso.\n Worick and Nic are in their 30\'s so technically they are too.\n\n Chief Daisuke Aramaki, the Mission Control of the Ghost in the Shell franchise.\n His brother, from what little we see of him, would also count.\n The Claw from GUN\xd7SWORD.\n For a heroic example, every member of the El Dora V.\n Gundam:\n Master Asia from Mobile Fighter G Gundam. Han the fisherman is pretty cool for a non-fighter.\n Mobile Suit Gundam 00 gave us Sergei Smirnov. Despite being not very bishounen (and obviously older) that most of bishounen/bishoujo protagonist cast, he has a crapton of fans for being a Colonel Badass Reasonable Authority Figure.\n Andrew Waltfeld from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED; the show\'s director specifically referred to him as a Cool Old Guy, and this fact, combined with the director\'s being friends with Andy\'s Voice Actor, are often credited with his Never Found the Body return from the "dead" later in the series.\n Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam reveals that Judau Ashta grew up into this. Not to mention become one of the only UC protagonists to survive into old age.\n Walter C. Dornez, the butler of the Hellsing.\n Family is also a prime example.\n\n Hunter \xd7 Hunter features 2 super-powered old men, Isaac Netero and Zeno Zoldyck. The former is the Chairman of the Hunter Association, where tough fights and Nen are needed JUST to qualify, and was World\'s Strongest Man  right until his death. The latter is the patriarch of one of the world\'s most dangerous assassins, where the kids are trained from birth itself to be able to cope with the Nen-infused world. He almost managed to defeat the former, not without great damage. And yes, both of them are friendly and amusing to their peerage.\n Initial D has three: dr. Toshiya "God Hand" Joushima, Kozo "God Foot" Hoshino, and Bunta Fujiwara himself. All three are top-tier racers, and nobody has ever beaten Bunta. Even when he\'s not serious.\n Joseph Joestar from Part 3 of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure. Not only does he fight vampires and telekinetic bad guys alongside the younger heroes, but he collects comic books and has a wickedly awesome sense of humor; the latter two are especially put into play in the finale chapter.  After being killed by Dio and having his blood drained, Joseph is brought back to life with a blood transfusion from Dio\'s remains. He pretends to be possessed by the vengeful spirit of Dio as a prank on Jotaro, and barely saves his skin from his angry grandson by stating his personal interests. Namely, that he collects comic books, that he knows Bo Derek starred in Tarzan, and that "Weird Al" Yankovic sang "Eat It". Jotaro relents, because "only he would know such stupid things".\n\n\n Technically count, Shiba Hiroshi in the sequel Kotetsushin Jeeg. While he is a cyborg and still looks like a normal adult, the sequel takes place 50 years after the original, and his girlfriend already has a grand-daughter as a reference of his age. His age doesnt affect his Badassery though.\n Legend of Galactic Heroes has Fleet Admirals Merkatz and Bucock from the Empire and Alliance respectively.\n Max Jenius in Macross 7. He might be 52, but he can still pretty much wipe the floor with everybody in the show, both in cockpit and with his bare hands, and he\'s the heroine\'s dad. Ah, BTW, he\'s also the fleet military commander.\n Max is another case of Older Than They Look. Word of God says it\'s because age is a state of mind and his genius allowed him to conquer it.\n Gil Graham of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A\'s. A kindly old English gent who also happens to be one of the most experienced and powerful mages under the Space-Time Administration Bureau\'s employ.  Though he turned out to be a Treacherous Advisor who was very reluctantly planning to seal the Book of Darkness together with Hayate once the book turns Omnicidal Maniac, the cast didn\'t blame him too much for it considering the complicated circumstances.\n In Mahou Sensei Negima!, while about half of Nagi\'s group could potentially count, Takahata-sensei and Graf Wilhelm are likely two very good examples. Takahata counting as old mostly because almost 90% of the cast is between 9 and 17. While god knows how old Wilhelm actually is. Takahata\'s teacher Gatou likely is one too but we rarely see him do anything but smoke in flashbacks.\n Hell, almost every old guy in the series could qualify, especially the (currently middle-aged) members of the Ala Rubra. Especially Jack Rakan.\n Dr. Juzo Kabuto from Mazinger Z. When Dr. Hell sicced an army of Humongous Mecha on him and his colleagues, he managed escaping alive. Afterwards he spent several years building the titular Humongous Mecha, an eighteen-meter-tall One-Man Army robot. When one of the henchmnen of Hell blew up his mansion, he got half-buried under several metal rafts, but in spite of he was moribund and trapped in an underground basement, he managed surviving several hours until his grandsons showed up and he could hand Mazinger over to the eldest (Kouji Kabuto). Also, he saved his son\'s life by turning him into a cyborg after he nearly got killed cause a lab experiment gone wrong. And in the manga and Shin Mazinger he overlaps this with Crazy Awesome.\n In Mon Colle Knights, Prince Eccentro\'s mentor Tanaka.\n\n Zelik and Graham from Mother Keeper, though they\'re only in their 50s.\n Professor Itsuki from Moyashimon. He\'s rather laid back for a college professor, referring to nearly everyone with the informal honorific "-kun". Though he does get rather passionate about fermented foods and his research into bioremediation.\n Naruto\n Third Hokage is a very kind, very awesome old man who cared for the people in his village. Just watch the scene where he visits the Academy class to talk to them about the village and the people he cares about. Watch  Naruto and his contemporaries\' memories of him at the funeral. Everyone has a memory about something awesome he did for them.\n The fact that Sarutobi Hiruzen was one in the real Uchiha massacre, even if he wasn\'t happy about it, has caused many fans to adopt a very cynical view of him, even though he is probably the single biggest reason Konoha isn\'t insane like Mist or as cruel as Sand. The fact that he runs a society of professional murderers who start before they hit puberty is kind of a reality check problem when compared to the actual events of the show. Except that he\'d gone through great lengths to try and prevent the Uchiha massacre from happening, and even Itachi pleaded with him that he protects Sasuke. Also, every village has been running a society of mercenaries before they hit puberty, possibly since around the time of the First Hokage himself.\n Jiraiya when he\'s not acting pervy.\n It\'s implied the Tsuchikage was less harsh in the past since Gaara\'s question seems to perturb him, and over the years he just grew more cynical with the shinobi world. With the world\'s constant militarization, and the fact that every major village had at least one tailed beast or dealings with Akatsuki by the beginning of Shippuden, he became cynical to match the times. What with the Magnetic Hero and Gaara, his protege, he\'s softening again.\n There\'s also the original Ino-Shika-Chou trio, aka the fathers of Team 10, although they\'re all in their forties.\n Zelretch from the Nasuverse (all of the works). When he was younger, he beat down and killed the "ultimate" being, Crimson Moon Brunestud (and in the process singlehandedly stopping the moon from falling into the Earth), only because of a minor dispute he had with it. He\'s also one of only five "True Magic" users \u2014 his magic? Operation of parallel worlds, which lets him do pretty much anything involving alternate universes.\n He pops into the "main" universe every now and then to take apprentices and screw with them until they\'re near useless from shock and trauma.\n Or until they become Badasses. Whatever comes first.\n Lord Yupa from Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind has traveled widely, is one of the most knowledgeable members of the cast, and is universally recognized as the best swordsman around.\n Bang from One-Punch Man is a quintessential Old Master of his martial art Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist, who runs his own dojo on top of his dedication to what he considers the duties of an S-Class hero.\n The Prince of Tennis has two: Ojii, the Rokkaku coach, and Banda Mikiya aka Banji from Yamabuki. Taro "Itte yosh" Sakaki of Hyoutei is still a bit young compared to them, but he\'s heading there.\n Just about any elderly person from Rave Master, but especially Shiba.\n Hiko Seijuuro from Rurouni Kenshin is in his forties when the main series takes place, but the man is easily in superhuman condition with strength light years beyond anyone.\n Subverted because Seijuuro looks significantly younger than his actual age; when Yahiko and Misao learn that he\'s 43, they\'re shocked and conclude that "Hiten Mitsurugi is the secret to eternal youth!!"\n Ditto for Kenshin, who also looks significantly younger than his thirty, despite quite a turbulent life.\n Played somewhat straighter with Okina, who is old and LOOKS it. Upbeat and always ready with a bad joke, he\'s not afraid of chasin\' some young skirts. He\'s also quite powerful in combat, being nearly a match for Aoshi...\n The highly skilled but aged and wearily bitter Shimada Kambei of Samurai 7. Quite possibly the reason Kirara surprisingly fell for him. Alas, his hardass nature solidifies when he coldly rejects her feelings before she can even get them out.\n In Snow White with the Red Hair, we have the heroine\'s father, who is  the leader of the vigilante-ish mercenary group, the Lions of the Mountains.\n Tenchi Muyo!: Katsuhito Masaki/Yosho is a mustached old man who can still kick ass. In the original OVA, he\'s actually physically younger than he appears, but in the Tenchi Universe and Tenchi in Tokyo series, he\'s genuinely old and a straighter example of the trope. Nobuyuki Masaki is this at times too.\n Old man Ichiryu from Toriko definitely counts. It\'s been determined that he was the apprentice of the creator of the current age, which was over five hundred years ago and he still looks like he\'s in his late 30\'s. He might also cross into Eccentric Mentor territory at times, but he can still throw fully powered Toriko around like a pizza. To top it all off he has a Badass Mustache that he can move at will.\n Lief the Lucky might have only appeared during the flash back arc of Vinland Saga, but he still came off as a cool old sailor who liked to tell kids stories about his journeys amongst the skraelingar.\n Even more so than Lief, there\'s the ever so popular Magnificent Bastard Askeladd and Ax-Crazy Thorkell.\n  Oboe from Violinist of Hameln manga is revealed to be this near the end. Whenever he decides to show his (really good-looking, despite the obvious signs of age) true form, an epic battle ensues.\n Grandpa Tanaka in Yandere Kanojo. He smokes, drinks, speaks informally, and it\'s implied he sleeps around with younger women (though not too young - when asked to charm a high school girl he was highly reluctant to do so). He\'s also good natured and friendly to just about everybody, and dispenses useful advice often. His grandson who lives with him, protagonist and arch-stoic Manabu, has a huge inferiority complex about it though.\n Sugoroku Mutou in Yu-Gi-Oh! (Solomon Muto in the dub), Yugi\'s grandfather, especially during the Grand Prix arc where he was Jonouchi\'s opponent during the first round.\n In Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, there was Dr. Albert Zweinstein. (An Expy of Albert Einstein, who would likely fit this Trope too.)\n Yanagi from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\'s. (But also a little loony.)\n Rokujuro Misawa in Yu Gi Oh Zexal (called simply Roku in the dub), the franchise\'s answer to the Old Master Trope. Jinlon appeared to fit the Trope too, but as it turned out  he was actually the spirit of Number 46: Dragluon in human form, still cool, but not an old guy.\n Genkai from YuYu Hakusho, although she is female, follows this trope better than Cool Old Lady. Oh, and also discounting the fact some of the teenage-appearing cast is Really 700 Years Old.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comic Books\xa0\n Captain America, despite looking like a man in his mid-twenties, is a 90 year old WW2 vet who can take on much younger heroes such as Black Panther and Daredevil and fight Batman to a stand still.\n Marvel\'s short-lived Alpha Flight revival featured an elderly superhero called Centennial, a little old man in a sweater who came out of a coma thanks to extremely delayed Puberty Superpowers identical to Superman\'s. He was played mostly for laughs, but when the team needed someone to give them a good kick in the pants for motivation, he was always ready to provide.\n Marvel also has Roger Aubrey (the Destroyer) and the Thin Man, and they did have Iron Cross, who was still active as a hero in the present day despite being old enough to have seen service in World War One, until he sacrificed himself to save the world.\n Ast\xe9rix: Getafix the Druid, maker of the magic potion, speaker of Gothic, one of the calmest and most sensible inhabitants of the village, and Badass Grandpa with Magnificent Bastard tendencies. No wonder the Romans are after him.\n Batman\'s butler Alfred is pretty darn cool, a magnificent example of the Servile Snarker, and dangerous when pushed.\n Batman becomes this whenever the timeline allows for it (usually in Elseworlds). The most famous example being Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. For an animated version, see Batman Beyond (and the Batman Beyond version of Old Bruce guest-stars in a time-travel episode of Justice League Unlimited... and proves to still be a downright scary interrogator, even moreso than his younger self!)\n Douwe Dabbert, a comic book series revolving entirely around a very old man.\n ElfQuest has a few examples.\n Likewise, after some initial misunderstandings have been cleared up, Lord Voll of the Gliders, who is even older, endears himself to the Wolfriders in much the same way. Unfortunately the trolls kill him.\n Then there\'s Ekuar, the wizened old rock-shaper, who retains his charm and wit despite having survived centuries of mistreatment by the trolls.\n The Justice Society of America is more or less built around this trope, along with that of the Legacy Character. Alan Scott, Jay Garrick, and Wildcat are pretty much the coolest old guys in the entire DC Universe.\n In fact, Jay Garrick is so cool that he\'s the guy Nightwing (the original Robin) wants to grow up to be.\n While not the Trope Namer, Garrick is referred to as "One cool old man." By Jack Knight in JSA #2.\n Wildcat slept with Wonder Woman\'s mom. That is all.\n Nick Fury, who\'s been standing up to supervillains since World War II and whose only power is his longevity and is a badass in every sense of the word. He was born in 1920.\n Scrooge McDuck \u2014 pick anywhere in the world, and he\'s been there. Pick any type of adventure, and he\'s done it.\n Sonic the Hedgehog: Uncle Chuck, who, despite being the one that built the roboticizer in the first place, still serves as a viable and reliable role model to his nephew.\n The Punisher, depending on the writer. Mainstream writers tend to downplay his age, but people who write the more hard-edged MAX stories acknowledge that he\'s in his late fifties. He is still a bigger badass than anyone else he faces.\n The Transformers: Kup, as is franchise-standard. He manages to yell at Optimus Prime and get away with it, and is one of the few Autobots to survive the series\' constant Kill \'em All situations without so much as a scratch. He\'s also this in IDW\'s Transformers works (The Transformers Megaseries, The Transformers: All Hail Megatron, The Transformers: Last Stand of the Wreckers...). Prowl even notes this when he has Kup turned into a Manchurian Agent, since it means Optimus Prime will listen to what Prowl has programmed Kup to say.\n X-Men: Charles Francis Xavier.\n Wolverine, whose healing factor slows down his aging immensely. He was born in the late 1800s but has looked like he\'s in his mid-to-late 30s since his introduction.\n Cable and Magneto also count, though Depending on the Artist means both are subject to suddenly being white-haired 20-year-olds.\n Magneto is actually physically in his 40s or so, having been de-aged and re-aged by one of his many experiments. And seeing as Quicksilver was born white-haired, it might just be genetic.\n Marvel supervillain Grizzly. Despite being a veteran super-crook he\'s a pretty nice guy when you get to know him, possessing a surprisingly strong set of morals and always being willing to help/give advice to others. He\'s also a badass who\'s tangled with many superheroes, almost none of whom actively dislike him. Once he robbed a guy while desperate for cash and when he got back on his feet he tracked the man down and bought him a pizza in order to apologize.\n Paulie in Circles is kind and caring and treats those close to him like family.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n Lezaford of The Tainted Grimoire. He has a pet Thundrake, is skilled in magic and provided a temporary place to stay for Clan Gully.\n Major-General Adiemus of the Holy Order of Juno, retired missionary and mercenary guild leader in Warriors of the World: Soldiers of Fortune. Over sixty and still going strong.\n Master White-Beard the Grey, Mentor to the Great and Powerful Trixie in An Extended Performance. He\'s gone now, but she reveres his memory, and he is one of the origins of Trixie\'s strange but very real code of honor.\n Kyoshi Rising has Master Lau Dan, Kyoshi\'s Earthbending instructor  and member of the White Lotus.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Animation\xa0\n Preston Whitmore from Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\n The Emperor of China from Mulan. Doesn\'t lose his cool even in the face of Shan Yu, and delivers a wonderful Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving bit.\n 2 of 9. One hundred percent.\n Rafiki from The Lion King.\n Sheriff Woody from the Toy Story films. If he was made in the 1950\'s, then he\'s roughly 60 years old in Toy Story 3.\n Carl Frederickson from Up crosses into this territory near the end, even though he starts out in Grumpy Old Man territory, even going into Badass Grandpa territory.\n Both Old Fred and Lord Mayor from Yellow Submarine.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n Many characters played by Anthony Quinn in his last years.\n Virtually any character Edward G. Robinson played in his later years.\n Any character played by Jackie Chan in the later part of his career. The guy still does all his own stunts and appears exclusively in films with high kicking action sequences.\n Tim\'s dad from About Time.\n In The Avengers, the Badass Bystander who stood up to Loki who was only credited as "Old German" after Loki\'s "born to be ruled" speech.\n Loki: In the end you will always kneel. Old German: Not to men like you. Loki: There are no men like me. Old German: There are always men like you.\n "Doc" Brown in the Back to the Future films. Especially his over-engineered gun in Back to the Future Part III. Admit it, you wanted one too.\n Shlomi\'s grandfather in Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi. He is the only person in the house who genuinely likes Shlomi. He also sabotages Doron\'s amp.\n Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack.\n Lord Willoughby in Captain Blood. He may be an old English windbag at first, but anyone with only a silver tongue and some good news as leverage who can turn a pirate crew who scoff at sailing for the King into loyal fighting sailors for the British Navy in five minutes is a force to be reckoned with.\n Walt Kowalski from Gran Torino. "Get off my lawn" never sounded so badass.\n Clint Eastwood in pretty much everything he has been in since about 1992. note\xa0 He had actually bought up the rights to Unforgiven years earlier, but choose to chew on it until he was old enough to play the main part.\n From The Dark Knight Saga\n Lucius Fox, Batman\'s snarky go-to guy for gadgets.\n Alfred Pennyworth, who like his comic book self is something of a Battle Butler.\n Desmond Llewelyn\'s portrayal of Q in the James Bond franchise.\n Pai Mei from Kill Bill Vol. 2.\n On that note, Bill himself. Not to mention Hattori Hanzo from Vol. 1.\n Indiana Jones:\n Indiana Jones becomes a Cool Old Guy in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\n And his father was one in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. (Where do you think Indy got it from?)\n John McClane becomes one by Live Free or Die Hard, similarly to the trilogy creeps of Indiana Jones and Rambo series.\n Raiden from the Mortal Kombat movie.\n Multiple SIDosis is an amateur short film in which Sid Leverents, who was 62 at the time the film was screened, plays the song "Nola" for the camera. As he breaks out more and more instruments the film breaks out into more and more split screens, until there are 11 different Sids playing and singing. This was a factory worker, making a movie by himself. Pretty cool.\n Malcolm Beech from Oblivion (2013) is this. His first scene is him smoking a big cigar and somewhat hammily interrogating and giving exposition to a captured Harper. He also mentions having fought on the war and having survived the devastation of Chicago. His biggest desire is down there on Foreshadowing.  Jack helps him fulfill his wish.\n Captain Teague on Pirates of the Caribbean. Not only is he the Keeper of the Code and Jack\'s Dad, he\'s also badass enough to shut a room full of brawling pirate captains (including Barbossa) up by merely entering the room.\n Granted, he shot one of them to punctuate his entrance. And when Jack asks if the Pirate Lords won\'t keep to the code, all it takes is a loud discordant guitar twang and a Death Glare to get an entire room full of Bad Ass pirates to sit down and shut up.\n Of course, being played by Keith Richards doesn\'t hurt.\n Barbossa himself is a bit of one.\n And Blackbeard, who is into his 70\'s. Also Teague\'s crew in At Worlds End, who all look to be quite tough.\n Roy from R.I.P.D., which makes it funny that his alternate appearance is a hot young blonde woman.\n Sal Bandini in Ready To Rumble.\n Secondhand Lions: Hub McCann. So, so much.\n Mako\'s character Mr. Lee from Sidekicks.\n Arnold Joseph from Smoke Signals.\n Spock Prime. from the most recent Star Trek movie. Also Captain Pike.\n Practically all of the Enterprise crew in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.\n Obi Wan from Star Wars. Make that all of The Obi Wans. Yoda is more of a Badass Grandpa.\n Palpatine initially comes across as a Cool Old Guy to Anakin, even though we in the audience already know of his true personality.\n Count Dooku. He\'s evil, but he\'s awesome. In Episode II, at least. Played by Christopher Lee, who was 85a and did around 80% of his own stunts. But not running.\n"I couldn\'t do the running. I was eighty! I said to George Lucas, I can do the swordfighting, but I can\'t run!"\n The Wiseman/ Bus Driver from Sucker Punch.\n Splinter, at the very end of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) movie, proves not to be such a stiff by making a funny joke.\n Splinter in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), if his speech about how family is the strongest power of all is anything to go by. If not that, then going up against the Shredder alone definitely makes him qualify, even if he does get beaten.\n The Hunt for Red October: Marko Ramius crushes his political officer\'s windpipe in one blow, falsifies his orders and burns the real ones, takes a nuclear ballistic missile sub to defect to the U.S., and evades detection by the entire Soviet Northern Fleet before blowing up a much more maneuverable Soviet Alfa-class attack submarine with its own torpedo and an American sub as a distraction. And he does all this successfully, without his own crew ever suspecting him.\n Robert De Niro impresses the younger generation in The Intern\n Mr Miyagi from The Karate Kid\n Sam The Lion in The Last Picture Show.\n Any character played by Sean Connery lately. \'Cause he\'s incapable of ever not being awesome, even when the movie itself isn\'t (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).\n Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega in The Mask of Zorro.\n Howard (Walter Huston) in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. He can identify fool\'s gold, talk Spanish to the Mexican natives, save a child whose life is in limbo after nearly drowning, shoot a gun just as good as any younger man (and at bandits, at that), has been on several gold hunting quests in his heyday, and of course, he guided them into the Sierra mountain range. Made even better in the fact that Huston was the father of John Huston (the director) and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, alongside his son, who won for Best Director. This role was young Huston\'s gift to his father, who had asked him to, "find a good role for his old man."\n Basil from The World\'s End.\n In Thor, Odin is the Badass Grandpa variant.\n Virgil Earp, as portrayed by Sam Elliot in Tombstone.\n Jetfire from Transformers.\nJetfire: My father was a wheel! The first wheel! Do you know what he transformed into? Sam: ...no? Jetfire: NOTHING! But he did it with DIGNITY!\n Sentinel Prime initially appears to be this to the other Autobots and their human allies, until he shows his true colors.\n Kevin Flynn in TRON: Legacy, who despite being an Technical Pacifist, demonstrates that he\'s badass enough that all he needs to do is enter a room and he can shut down everything currently inside simply from his presence. Doesn\'t hurt that he\'s a Physical God in this world... after all, he built it.\n In the first TRON film, Walter Gibbs and his digital counterpart Dumont fall into this territory. Gibbs was the guy who founded Encom, but was more interested in scientific development than money. He invented the laser that got it all started. He was also the only person on-screen who dared to tear Dillinger a new one to his face over the way things were run. His counterpart, Dumont, was the one who allowed Tron to get in contact with Alan via his tower and download the upgrade that eventually destroyed Master Control. Sark\'s forces eventually catch him, and he\'s remarkably snarky and sarcastic to them, even in the face of certain de-rez.\n Vitruvius from The LEGO Movie. He\' an extremely talented Master Builder, and is able to take on a small army of Lord Business\'s minions with nothing but a makeshift walker/nunchucks. He\'s also voiced by Morgan Freeman.\n Another Sam Elliot portrayal is Sgt. Maj. Plumbley from We Were Soldiers. May cross into Badass Grandpa, but as the character tells a large group of young ruperts: "If anyone of you sumbitches calls me gram-paw... I\'ll kill ya!"\n X-Men:\n Charles Xavier has an almost grandfatherly sort of relationship with his students during his older years.\n Wolverine. While he looks forty, he\'s over 150.\n Beast from X-Men: The Last Stand, is much older than Storm and Jean, but as destructive as Wolverine.\n Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Aumont) in Day for Night.\n The King from Cinderella (2015). He takes Ella running into him as she flees the palace in stride and ultimately agrees to his son pursuing the mysterious maiden, since he\'s moved by her telling him that Kit is a wonderful man who loves his father.\n Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in Bridge of Spies is portrayed as a surprisingly likable and sympathetic character who is just trying to serve his country. He\'s also unflappably calm in the face of impending death.\nJames Donovan: Aren\'t you worried?  Rudolf Abel: Would it help?\n Two different examples in Hussar Ballad:\n Field Marshal Kutuzov is old and fat, but he is a great leader, respected by absolutely everybody in the army, who, eventually, defeats invading Napoleon armies.\n Ivan, main character\'s batman. He is old, but strong, and a formidable fighter.\n Backup Deputy Sheriff Chicory in Bone Tomahawk.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Dragon Bones has Haverness, who is known for his loyalty and trustworthiness. He\'s also a very efficient fighter, men half his age are proud if he has to really work for his victory in a training fight against them.  He has sworn allegiance to the high king, and takes this very seriously, but when the high king refuses to send aid to his homeland, he starts a rebellion, reasoning that it was the high king who broke his oath first.\n P. G. Wodehouse\'s novels have Uncle Fred and the Honourable Galahad, who regularly helping their younger acquaintances out of trouble, often with rather impressive Zany Schemes. Uncle Fred gets extra points for knocking the hat off the pompous barrister Sir Beefy Bastable with a slingshotted Brazil nut.\n A Tale of Two Cities: Mr. Lorry. He is a 75 years old businessman, his business include being a banker, hostage negotiatior, and help refugees to flee the country.\n Fraa Jad in Neal Stephenson\'s Anathem. This avout of the millenarians is a master of pithy one-liners, and has the ability to wander between parallel time tacks.\n Most of the disciples of Aldur in David Eddings\' Belgariad universe, but especially Belgarath and Beldin.\n Brother Cadfael.\n Khlit of the Curved Sword (aka Khlit the Wolf) from the Cossack stories by Harold Lamb is already retirement age when he first appears in a story. He chooses not to accept mandatory retirement and goes on walkabout through Asia instead, having many exciting adventures. Along the way, Khlit becomes both Kha Khan of the Tatars and Koschevoi Ataman of the Cossacks (but not at the same time). He\'s often underestimated by people who don\'t realize how tough a Cossack had to be to reach an advanced age. Even when Khlit relinquishes the protagonist role to his (adoptive) grandson Kirdy because he\'s no longer able to wield his famous sword effectively, Khlit remains a cunning fox, and quite capable of licking twice his weight in mooks.\n Cohen and his Silver Horde, of Discworld fame. Not one cool old guy, but seven (eventually six, but in their most recent story they pick up a Cool Old Lady).\n Commander Samuel Vimes fits this in his most recent stories. After all, he\'s over 50! (When Night Watch threw him thirty years into the past, the version of himself he met there seemed to be only in his late teens, and he describes a 51 year old vampire as \'not a lot younger than him\' in "Thud".)\n Vetinari. About as old as Vimes (if not older). Not only a political mastermind skilled at manipulating people to act in his favour but a former assassin of incredible skill.\n Ridcully, especially when he has a crossbow in his hand.\n One of his predecessors, Galder Weatherwax, was almost as good, but lost it, after going against fate by trying to capture Rincewind.\n And, Lu Tze the living embodiment of (if not inspiration for) Rule 1: "Do not act incautiously when confronting little bald wrinkly smiling men." The one and only master of Deja Fu, with a reputation that makes men who know of him wet their pants (literally in at least one case) if they learn they have crossed him, and he kicked the ass of the new anthropomorphic personification of Time itself.\n Also Reg Shoe, he\'s not much older than Vimes, but he\'s 30 years dead (dies at the end of Night Watch).\n Various other Zombies and Vampires would fit if \'cool\' could be used to describe them.\n The old Count Bella de-Magpyr in Carpe Jugulum is, as is Lady Margalotta.\n Alberto Malich, the Wizard who started UU. 87 years old when he blew himself into Death\'s Domain, and it\'s been almost 2,000 years since.\n Dios from Pyramids. Okay, maybe not actually cool, but old can\'t be used to describe him, he\'s a freaking 7000 year old stable time-loop.\n Abraham van Helsing from Dracula.\n In Aaron Allston\'s Galatea in 2D, the protagonist\'s father C. J. teaches them all how to use guns. He also does all the cooking.\n Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter. And after  he dies, we get his brother, Aberforth, who is very nearly as cool as he is. Too bad their relationship was, well, rather troubled.\n There\'s Mad-Eye Moody, too. Leaving aside that much of the cool stuff we actually see him do is a Death Eater impersonating him rather well, he\'s annoying and insane but pretty cool.\n About ninety percent of persons in the Honor Harrington series. Honor herself is 65 in the most recent stories. Yes prolong makes everyone seem younger. But prolong has been around only about 2 generations so there are few people over 120 yet.\n Mia\'s grandpa from If I Stay. He drives her to auditions and talks to her when she\'s in a coma.\n Nestor from Homer\'s Iliad is one of these, he is the oldest man in the Greek army and was a young adventurer contemporary with the previous generation of heroes, including Hercules, Perseus, Theseus, and Achilles\' father Peleus, he says that all of these previous heroes were stronger fighters than any of the Greeks attacking Troy, including Achilles. He is the frequent source of advice, counsel, and long monologues about the olden days. He is an old badass, because he is still gearing up and fighting with the young men on foot and on chariot - and he is a better fighter than most of them! The fact that he survived to old age without being killed in Greek warrior society is taken as a testament to his great wisdom.\n The Mariner from the Keys to the Kingdom. He has a magical harpoon so powerful it hurts others just to use it (he calls his \'friend\'), and a ship that can sail through suns.\n Woodrow Lowe, age 108, from James Thayer\'s Man of the Century.\n Popsy in the eponymous story Nightmares and Dreamscapes by Stephen King.  He is the little vampire boy\'s grandfather and kills Sheridan for even trying to do so.\n Cristobal Junta from Monday Begins on Saturday.\n In the Petaybee books, Whittaker Fiske is not only cool but far more progressive than his son- he\'s completely open to the idea that Petaybee might be sentient when few off-worlders are.\n Raptor Red brings us a Cool Old Dactyl in the form of... the white dactyl. Old even by dactyl standards, he has bowed out of the great play of reproduction and chick-rearing, choosing to instead spend his golden years dicking around with the other predators.\n Huang Zhong in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Dynasty Warriors video game.\n Lord Varano from Samuel Shellabarger\'s Prince of Foxes, a historical novel of the Italian Renaissance. This upright old knight teaches cynical Guile Hero Andrea Orsini the meaning of honor. Lord Varano\'s Crowning Moment of Awesome scene, in which the folk of Citt\xe0 Del Monte elect to fight for him despite believing they are doomed to defeat by Cesare Borgia, is among the classic examples of both tropes.\n Ruy Sanchez de Casador y Ortiz from 1632: Over sixty years old but still besting swordsmen half his age, and winning the heart of a twentieth century woman with wit and panache.\n Captain Flint from the Swallows and Amazons series is the only adult the protagonists seem to take entirely seriously.\n Zedd in the Sword of Truth saga.\n Though Nathan is even older and in most cases even cooler. Someone who can serve as estrogen brigade bait (in-universe, anyway) at nearly a thousand years old, be one of the only existing prophets in the world, and be such a powerful wizard and (implied) swordsman to boot definitely deserves a mention here.\n Li Kao from Barry Hughart\'s The Chronicles of Master Li series falls under this.\n Giles Corey from The Crucible.\n And from real life. The part about his death was true.\n Roland Deschain of The Dark Tower series is not only is he several decades older than the rest of his ka-tet and the epitome of The Gunslinger, but he is also  possibly several hundred millennia old, due to his having repeated his life over countless times after reaching the Tower. He\'s totally unaware of that last fact, though.\n The Dresden Files:\n Shiro from Death Masks as a Japanese Knight of the Sword who, while looking like somebody\'s grandfather, manages to kick Denarian ass. Even Nicodemus, leader of the Denarians, is afraid of this guy. The RPG states that he has plot device levels of swordsmanship, which says it all really.\n Harry\'s mentor Ebenezer McCoy fits also, although he\'s a wizard and not a Badass Normal.\n The entire Senior Council. The Merlin held off an army of vampires and Eldritch Abominations with a single ward, and is pretty much based on Christopher Lee. Listens to Wind is a nice old medic and shaman. He also once shapeshifted into a bear the size of a minibus to beat the crap out of an Eldritch Abomination /Physical God of fear. Simon Pietrovich had a death curse powerful enough to wipe out several Red Court nobility and their allies. Aside from Cristos, all other Senior council members qualify by default.\n Michael Carpenter by the time of "The Warrior". A half-crippled former knight takes on a much younger former Marine and beats the crap out of him.\n Professor Henry Armitage of H.P. Lovecraft\'s The Dunwich Horror; a university scholar in his 70\'s who takes it upon himself (and a couple other professors) to get bitch-slap the earthborn spawn of Yog-Sothoth.\n Bodger the old bull terrier from The Incredible Journey. He\'s a dogfighting veteran who spent his younger days terrorizing the local cats with his right-hand cat and best friend Tao the Siamese, and in his golden years is a loveable goof who simply wants and gets lots of love from humans.\n Gandalf of The Lord of the Rings. His impressiveness isn\'t just because he\'s a wizard, but because most of the hobbits he\'s friends with usually describe him in grandfatherly terms.\n Also deserves a mention for The Movie, as he\'s played by Sir Ian McKellen. Old guys don\'t come much cooler than him. Except for Sir Christopher Lee, who played Saruman, and who was still badass despite being too old to walk up a flight of stairs smoothly.\n Most of the elves are pretty awesome, and some of them are older than the kingdom of Numenor. Legolas\' age is never directly stated, but estimates range from 500 to about 3,000 years old. Book Legolas refers to the whole rest of the Fellowship, except possibly Gandalf because he was still dead when the remark was made, as \'children.\' Movie Legolas is referred to as \'lad\' by Gimli, which may be due to their relative ages compared to expected life-spans. The rest of the Fellowship are either young or middle-aged according to their race, though special mention goes to Gimli at 140 and Aragorn at 88.\n Santiago, the titular old man in Ernest Hemingway\'s The Old Man and the Sea.\n The Railway Series: Edward, Toby, Skarloey, Rheneas, Duke. All of them but Toby were built in the nineteenth century, and all are still in active service. Skarloey and Rheneas would currently be 146 years old. Also applies to Sir Topham Hatt I and Sir Topham Hatt II during certain parts of the series\' timeline. Out-of-universe, applies to the original author, the late Rev. Wilbert Awdry, and his son Christopher Awdry who is the current author.\n Great-uncle Ebbitt from The Seventh Tower combines this with Crazy Awesome.\n Abraham Setrakian of The Strain, a holocaust survivor that teaches two doctors, an exterminator, and a gaggle of gangsas how to slay some monstrous vampires.\n Many characters in The Wheel of Time. Thom Merrilin, Rhuarc, Gareth Bryne, Furyk Karede, Noal Charin, and the male Forsaken at least.\n The short story They Live Forever has a subversion of this trope. The narrator becomes a Cool Old Guy at 25 when he is stranded on a planet where the natives have a life cycle of two years. He is proportionally so old by the end of the story that he realizes his age would be meaningless to them and claims to have forgotten. This mirrors the original immortal of the story who made the same claim about himself when questioned by the narrator.\n Papa Jan from This Perfect Day.\n In Robert A. Heinlein\'s Time Enough for Love, this applies not to Lazarus Long himself, two-thousand years old though he may be, but to his grandfather, Ira Johnson. At seventy he was heartbroken not to be able to enlist in the army to fight in World War One, played a mean game of chess, and could kick ass nine ways from Sunday. He also raised his daughter Maureen on the principles of Eternal Sexual Freedom, which had major repercussions on the future of the human race, including Lazarus himelf.\n Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird. He\'s obviously also a Magnificent Bastard, minus the Bastard part. Hell, one of his responses to an argument is something along the lines of stating "You think you\'re about to win?", which he only said when he knew he would win an argument, or had a back up plan for what they were about to say. He\'s the model of a father that every child wants.\n Noirtier from The Count of Monte Cristo. When his granddaughter is facing an arranged marriage she doesn\'t want, he foils it by  confessing to the murder of the prospective groom\'s father.\n Henry Bacon from The Last Dragon Chronicles.\n Grandfather (not his actual name, but how he is known in history) from Lands Of Ice And Mice, who almost single-handedly brings about the first peaceful contact and cultural interchange between the Greenlander Norse and the Thule.\n Charlie and the Chocolate Factory reveals that the Impossible Genius of confectionery Willy Wonka, who looks middle-aged, is actually this ("I\'m an old man. I\'m much older than you think."), a reason he turns out to be seeking an heir. He\'s definitely this in the 2013 West End stage musical, in which he has been a Reclusive Artist for over 40 years and was making sweets back when Mathatma Gandhi was alive. Also, Charlie\'s Grandpa Joe is a downplayed example \u2014 bedridden until Charlie finds his ticket, but always fun to be with \u2014 in most versions, and definitely an example in the 1971 film adaptation owing to his Deadpan Snarker tendencies ("If [Veruca Salt\'s] a lady then I\'m a Vermicious Knid!").\n A Harvest Of War gives us Raghnall Bors and Tadhg.\n Scholarly,eccentric, aristocratic Sixtus Claudius Julianus in Search The Seven Hills is actually a retired Roman general and ex-governor of Antioch, one of the Empire\'s wretched hives of scum and villainy. He can even make Christians shut up with a stern look.\n In Arn: The Knight Templar, this role falls to brother Guilbert de Beaune, a disgraced Templar and Arn\'s teacher. In the final book, he is invited to participate in Arn\'s stag night, an event which involves a contest of arms consisting of seven events. In spite of being three times the age of the other participants, not having touched a weapon in decades, never having practiced one event (spear throwing) and never having seen another (axe throwing), he places second.\n Saeter from the The Iron Teeth free web serial is one of these. He is grey haired and noticeably older than all the other bandits and yet still by far the best tracker and a dangerous warrior. He is a somewhat grumpy hardass though.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n Game Shows:\n The Price Is Right: Bob Barker, who remained an icon to many before his retirement at age 83. College kids who were young enough to be his grandchildren pined at the chance to meet him and play a pricing game with the TV legend.\n Jeopardy!: Alex Trebek, now 74 years old, fits the trope and is virtually synonymous with the show. (By comparison, original host Art Fleming was in his mid 50s when he hosted his final Jeopardy!)\n Wheel of Fortune, at age 67, Pat Sajak is still going strong, and a majority of today\'s contestants weren\'t even born when he took over for Chuck Woolery (also pretty cool in his old age) in 1981.\n As Time Goes By: Rocky, Lionel\'s octogenarian father, who likes to "boogie" at the Hard Rock Cafe, frequently travels the world on adventures with his new wife Madge, and is constantly encouraging the gang to "Rock on!"\n Battlestar Galactica (2003):\n Bill Adama, Saul Tigh (2000 years old, as a matter of fact), and Dr.  Sherman Cottle\n Evil/Frakken\' Sinister Old Guys:  John Cavil  a wangsty teen with mommy issues in an old man\'s body, which happens to be modeled on "mommy\'s" old man, and also slept with "mommy"; Tom Zarek  who was probably pretty bad before the Caprica-shattering-kaboom and dared to pull a mutiny on Galactica.\n Blue Heelers: Tom Croydon has his moments, but special mention has to go to Superintendent Adamson. One episode has him on a raid to flush out a group of dangerous criminals. After the police hold their ground as their car speeds towards them as they are shot at with automatic handguns and rifles, one of the cops manages to disable the vehicle with a shotgun, before a number of police from both stations swarm in. What makes this cool is one of them resists and break away from the officers only to run into Adamson (and Inspector Fawlkner, also aged in his sixties). They both flatten him, making them not only Cool Old Guys but the scene their Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer:\n Requisite Mutant Enemy reference: Rupert Giles. He wasn\'t actually old, being only in his mid-forties at the start of the series, but that\'s still more than twice the average age of the main characters (Dawson Casting notwithstanding). Plus, the fact that he started out as a geek and became progressively more badass over the course of the series means that he actually got cooler as he got older.\n The vampires don\'t get to apply, even if Spike is cool. He doesn\'t look or operate old.\n Castle: Captain Roy Montgomery, Beckett\'s boss. Driven home in "Kill the Messenger" when a big-name political family tries to interfere in their investigation and Montgomery very politely tells them to get stuffed. The guy threatens to get the police commissioner involved. Montgomery\'s response?\n Montgomery: Say hi to him for me. And tell him I could really use a raise. I think we\'re done here. (Blake Wellsley leaves) Castle: That was awesome!!\n Criminal Minds:\n Special Agent David Rossi starts out looking like a Grumpy Old Man, but his coolness becomes apparent pretty early on, and he just gets cooler from there.\n Agent Gideon: he\'s a cool character, he\'s played by Mandy Patinkin and he\'s Inigo Montoya.\n Curb Your Enthusiasm: Larry David wears sneakers, is regarded as cool by his younger black friend Leon, had an attractive wife who was at least 20 years younger. He\'s regarded as not having grown up properly by most of the characters.\n Doctor Who:\n The Doctor. Especially his first incarnation, who was created precisely with this trope in mind. William Hartnell doesn\'t take lip from anyone, young man! Hmmm hmmm! But let\'s also remember the character is very very old, even when he doesn\'t show it physically.\n One of the best examples being in The Space Museum, when the First Doctor pretends to be unconscious after three Xerons grab him and then knocks out one of his captors when the other two leave the room ("It was like a whirlwind hit me!") and then hides in a Dalek casing in the museum.\n Also, the Third Doctor\'s frequent demonstrations of Venusian aikido.\n Roger Delgado\'s Master is an evil Cool Old Guy.\n Ahem. Wilfred Mott, anyone? Among many other feats of badassery, he took on a Dalek with a paintball gun. Sure, it only worked temporarily, but mad points for style and cojones. Also doesn\'t hurt that Bernard Cribbins is an amazing actor whose apparent mission in life is to break our hearts.\n When we meet Wilf for the first time, having no idea who he is (he\'s Donna\'s grandad, but she didn\'t mention him last Christmas, and won\'t return until the next episode), it\'s as the only person in town. We think the plot is about to revolve around what made London a ghost town at Christmas, but we learn from Wilf that everyone else has fled, having gotten Genre Savvy (the Christmas Special is always blockbuster, so by season three, everyone clears out of London around the time, as history has proven that the shit is really going to hit the fan on the 25th.) However, Wilf refused to leave and stood his ground, never leaving the newsstand he runs.\n Plus, he is a very cool-tempered Brit.\n ESPN\'s football College GameDay has this in Lee Corso, who combines this with Crazy Awesome through his antics\u2014most famously, his tradition of announcing his pick for the winner of the day\'s featured (8:00 Eastern Time) game by donning the headgear of the piked team\'s mascot. This has led to some fairly ridiculous situations, like the time he dressed himself as a tree and danced around the set to pick Stanford over USC (October 29, 2011). It also usually gets a big response from the people around him: the show is transmitted from the campus of the home team for that day\'s game, and there is usually a crowd of students and other fans behind the set, so they see his pick, and cheer or boo accordingly.note\xa0That one elicited boos from the USC home crowd, but at least he had the consolation of being right; the previous week, he had donned Wisconsin\'s badger head rather than home team Michigan State\'s Spartan helmet, only to see the Spartans win on a Hail Mary. Less absurdly, but just as amusingly, he calls everyone "sweetheart". Also, this. (It\'s a bit exaggerated, but...).\n Farscape:\n John Crichton becomes one of these in the alternate timeline featured in the episode "The Locket". According to Ben Browder on the DVD commentary for this episode, the Cool Old Guy effect carried over into real life when he found he could get away with a lot of things while dressed in the rather convincing aging makeup.\n Crichton\'s dad, Jack Crichton, played by Kent Mc Cord of Adam-12 fame, definitely fits the trope, even when he\'s being impersonated by an alien.\n Firefly:\n Shepherd Book. He\'s religious so he practices Thou Shalt Not Kill, but acknowledges that The Bible is "a mite fuzzier on kneecaps."\n Until Serenity, in which he\'s forced to shoot down the Alliance ship destroying his colony before he dies from his injuries.\n That wasn\'t very Christian of him.\n Also Murphy from the Firefly episode "Shindig." He expertly puts a Rich Bitch who\'s tormenting Kaylee in her place, then spends the entire evening talking about engines with the latter.\n Speaking of Shindig, Sir Warwick Harrow.\n The film Serenity implies that Mal is actually 50.\n Martin from Frasier. He is really a wise person to look up to.\n Richard from Friends.\n Game of Thrones: There\'s quite a few. Rodrik Cassel, loyal affably retainer to the Starks. Lord Umber, boisterous Modest Royalty and fiercely loyal to the Starks. Qyburn, something of a morally dubious Mad Doctor who\'s nonetheless effective, respectful, and intent on wiping out diseases, even Cersei, who hate\'s most other characters, admits to being fond of him.\n Highlander: The Series: Methos through his age and general coolness factor. In fact, general fandom often refers to him as the Really Old Guy. A Subverted Trope exists in the fact that, as an immortal, he looks really young. Joe Dawson also qualifies.\n Hustle: Albert (Robert Vaughn).\n JAG: Admiral Chegwidden (John M. Jackson) and Admiral Boone (Terry O\'Quinn).\n Jeopardy!: One current game show host who fits the mold is Alex Trebek (born in 1940). Trebek gets bonus points for chasing down a burglar and helping catch her. [1]\n While not having been so originally, Takeshi Hongo, the original Kamen Rider, is still an active participant in the battle against evil to this day, 45 years later.\n Bonus points for his actor, Hiroshi Fujioka, also still being active in his original role as the man onscreen.\n Knight Rider: Devon Miles from the original show. Among his more awesome moments are escaping two prison camps in WWII and Mac Gayvering a bomb, kicking down a steel door and getting into a fist fight with a psychopath.\n Las Vegas: "Big" Ed Deline is arguably cooler than the show\'s main character.\n Law & Order: Lennie Briscoe. When a 60-something year old man is the most popular character in a cast full of Fair Cops and Hello Attorneys, you know he\'s doing something right.\n Leverage: Both James Whittaker III on Hustle and Archie Leach, both played by Richard Chamberlain.\n Lost: John Locke. Subverted Trope when we discover just how pathetic and needy the guy is, though he\'s definitely starting to work back up to a traditional Cool Old Guy. Double Subverted. Turns out he is just a pathetic and needy loser.\n Lost Girl: Trick  aka the Blood King.\n M*A*S*H: Col. Potter.\n Merlin:\n In the 1998 series, the title wizard gradually becomes one of these as the film progresses, and can be seen telling his story to the younger generations in the present.\n Also of note is the Mountain King, an ancient Time Abyss voiced by James Earl Jones who casually talks about the dawn of time. "If I can remember that, it means that I\'m an old man!"\n Merlin:\n The current (2008-2012) TV series also has one of these in the character of Gaius.\n Uther has a claim, too, despite technically being kind of the villain. Gaius is pretty morally compromised himself.\n Merlin himself in his disguise as the elderly sorcerer "Dragoon, The Great!". Later becomes on for real in the series epilogue, which reveals Merlin is still alive in the present day.\n Mortal Kombat: Conquest: Raiden. His characterization was based on that of the movie\'s Raiden, which explains a lot.\n NCIS: Gibbs, his father, Eli David, Ducky, and Tony\'s father.\n Revolution: Ken \'Hutch\' Hutchinson in episode 5. He\'s the last surviving rebel of the group in his town.  Subverted Trope, when he reveals that his rebel wife was killed by the Monroe militia and that he\'s so obsessed with Revenge Before Reason that he is willing to blow up a train with Danny Matheson in it, and stab Nora Clayton in the gut when she tried to stop him.\n Scandal:\n Cyrus starts out as one, but the trope is actually deconstructed  as he proves himself to be Olivia\'s Arch-Enemy.\n The madam in episode 2 is morally ambiguous, but proves herself by the end.\n Smallville: Jonathan Kent is pretty cool, as he\'s probably the Only Sane Man in the cast a lot of the time, as well as a Badass Normal Papa Wolf who goes out of his way to protect his son. And then there\'s a villainous example in Lionel Luthor. Already pretty darn cool as the Love to Hate Trope Codifier for Magnificent Bastard, Lionel\'s eventual Heel\x96Face Turn let him establish Intergenerational Friendships with the rest of the cast, mock his Big Bad son Lex, and go right on being cool.\n Spellbinder: Regent Correon. The oldest and toughest of the Spellbinders, over the course of the series he manages to survive a trip through the Wasteland, takes command of the fanatically anti-Spellbinder Marauders, and trumps Ashka\'s plans for world domination with just a video camera and some very loyal decoys.\n Star Trek:\n Doctor McCoy had elements of this trope, even though he didn\'t really get to interact with many kids.\n In many ways, he was Kirk\'s father-figure, with Spock as the competing "cool uncle". Thus, while Spock could shame Kirk, only McCoy could outright scold him to his face. In one or two episodes, for medical reasons, McCoy did the equivalent of sending Kirk to his room!\n He\'s not exactly a domesticated red junglefowl of the growing season in most temperate climates in Encounter at Farpoint, but has lost none of his coolness.*\n Star Trek: The Next Generation: Jean-Luc Picard showed enough combat and survival skill in his 60s that he could easily have been a one-man commando unit.\n Stargate SG-1:\n General Hammond could\'ve been the trope namer. Col. Jack O\'Neill aged into this trope during the 10 years of the series.\n Brought-out-of-retirement Jack in the Stargate movie started out as this trope, especially to the kids of Abydos. As well as the Death Seeker with some Knight Templar and \'that military guy who always follows his orders even if they\'re wrong\'...they got a new actor and changed his character a lot for the show. Apparently Daniel gave him an epiphany.\n Yeah...jut look at season one or two Jack and go, "there\'s a guy who tried to commit suicide by nuke a couple years ago." Break your brain.\n Bra\'tac, who\'s even older then those two.\n Supernatural:\n Bobby manages to be the Only Sane Man (although not without his issues) and completely and utterly awesome at the same time.\n Even if he did have only one scene in season three, the fandom reaction to Rufus was so overwhelmingly positive that they brought him back for appearances in seasons five through seven.\n Teen Wolf: Dr Deaton. He doesn\'t even flinch when an Alpha Peter Hale comes after him.\n The Class: Yonk Allen.\n The Dukes of Hazzard: Jesse Duke, the Duke family patriarch, is a very no-nonsense old man, and everyone gives him proper respect. He was one of the best moonshine runners in his heyday, and he\'s no slouch when it comes to helping his kin get out of trouble. He\'s also one of the only people who can keep his nephews under control.\n The Equalizer: Robert McCall may be ~50 years old, but he knows kung fu (or something) and can handle any gun.\n The Muppet Show: Statler and Waldorf from this show and its spin-offs, movies and specials could be considered this.\n The Professionals: Cowley.\n The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Brigadier himself. That\'s Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart to you.\n The Walking Dead:\n Hershel Greene. He\'s pushing seventy, but can still hold his own in a firefight. He just doesn\'t like to...\n Reg Monroe. He\'s around sixty and he\'s a lovable and charismatic guy with everyone. Accepted to teach Noah about architecture and stood for Rick after the latter\'s fight with Pete.\n The West Wing: Jed Bartlet and Leo Mc Garry. Admiral Percy Fitzwallace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n The Wire: Lester Freamon. One of the smartest characters in the entire show and probably the most effective cop. Cool Lester Smooth.\n The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles: The group of old soldiers and hunters in Africa led by Frederick Selous (Paul Freeman) that Indy meets and help him blow up the "Phantom Train of Doom".\n Top Gear: The presenters.\n V (1983): Abraham Bernstein is a Holocaust survivor who figures out exactly what the Visitors\' real agenda is and does everything he can to fight them, including teaching some kids the proper way to deface a Vistor propaganda poster.\n Vintergatan: Peo Persson from this Swedish sci-fi children\'s comedy show. Began as a Grumpy Old Man, ended up a Cool Old Guy who could really rock a saxophone and smoked his pipe in big huffs.\n Warehouse 13: Artie. "And that...is one of 23 ways that I could have escaped."\n Wheel of Fortune: One current game show host who fits the mold is Pat Sajak (born in 1946).\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Multimedia\xa0\n Uhm, Uncle Sam. You know, this guy.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n Many musical artists from the 1960s and 1970s such as Fleetwood Mac; Chicago; Crosby, Stills, Nash (And Young); Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, and James Taylor are still going strong today. As are both of the surviving Beatles \x96 Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. Chuck Berry\'s music dates from the \'50s and he\'s still going strong.\n Ditto for Stevie Wonder; Earth, Wind & Fire; and Lionel Richie.\n Frank Sinatra was like this in the second half of his career. (In fact, he was probably even cooler than he was when he was younger.)\n Same goes for countless country artists, with George Strait being the most successful of the lot (currently, at least from a radio and album sales standpoint). Others are way too numerous to mention, although guys like Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Hank Williams, Jr. immediately come to mind.\n Late in his life, Johnny Cash very much fit this trope. So did George Jones.\n Thanks to his collaborations with Alan Jackson and the Zac Brown Band, Jimmy Buffett (now in his mid-60s) can be considered cool in his elderly life.\n And for 1970s and early-1980s hard rock and metal musicians, who are past 50 (some of them even pushing 60) by now, like AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and the aforementioned Aerosmith.\n The Rolling Stones. Both Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are 70, and the band\'s been touring for more than 50 of those years. Do they seem like they\'re gonna stop any time soon? Very probably not.\n Jazz singer Tony Bennett. After his career tanked in The \'60s, he\'s staged an amazing comeback, keeping light bouncy jazz alive and kickin\' since 1994 (and has no intention of retiring, according to The Other Wiki).\n Little Jimmy Dickens is in his 90s, but that doesn\'t stop him from making humorous cameos around Brad Paisley. At one time, he was brought out during an awards show to make a joke pertaining to Kanye West\'s interruption of Taylor Swift.\n Leonard Bernstein introduced kids in The Fifties and The \'60s to Classical Music through his TV specials, and also did a special on pop music in 1967.\n Nomeansno singer and bassist, Rob Wright, was pushing 30 when they put out their first album, which meant he was older than most punk musicians at the time and he turned middle aged shortly after they developed their cult following. In fact, the cover art to their compilation album, The People\'s Choice, depicts graffiti on a restroom stall that reads, "How fucken [sic] old are Nomeansno? Give it up, granddads." Drummer John Wright added and signed his own graffiti beneath this: "That\'s \'great granddads\' to you, fucker!"\n Ed Cassidy, drummer for 1960s LA rock group Spirit. The guy was about 20 years older that the others and was the stepfather of guitarist Randy California, yet managed to take a genuine liking to the band\'s music. Plus, he was no slouch when he came to drumming.\n Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen. Their dedication to their fans is legendary.\n Carlos Santana, in his 60s, still plays guitar just as amazing as ever, creates some of the best rock albums in mainstream music, is dedicated to his beliefs and his fans, and still remains just as awesome as he did 40 years ago.\n Frank Zappa after age 50 was still recording, remastering and composing, despite suffering from cancer, which he died from at age 52.\n John Lee Hooker was still performing on stage in his eighties and released a best-selling album The Healer when he was about 82 years old.\n Buena Vista Social Club: When they released their 1997 global best-selling album most musicians were veterans who were already in their seventies, eighties and nineties. The oldest was Compay Segundo (1907-2003), who was 89 at time of recording the album. Special notice goes out to Rub\xe9n Gonz\xe1lez, who suffered from artritis, yet still managed to give away amazing performances!\n French singer Henri Salvador, from the 1930s until his death in 2008 he was still performing and releasing new albums.\n Operette and cabaret singer Johannes Heesters (1903-2011) was over 100 years old and still sang and performed at the stage! Not only that but he only gave up smoking a half year before he died.\n Robert Pollard is 57, and he still puts out at least four albums every year.\n Jet Black, the drummer for The Stranglers, was nearly 40 when the band came to fame, making him far older than most of his contemporaries (and the rest of the band). He\'s still playing with them at the age of 76, despite serious health issues which mean he can\'t play a full set any more or tour outside of the UK.\n "Weird Al" Yankovic: He\'s been making parody songs since 1976 and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pro Wrestling\xa0\n In Professional Wrestling, any wrestler in his late 40s and beyond who can still kick ass and take a beating definitely counts.\n The most recent examples: Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker at WrestleMania 25. WOW. Three men over 40 (and in Steamboat\'s case, almost 60 and had been retired since suffering a career-ending back injury in a match against "Stunning" Steve Austin"- from a bump on the apron, not from something Austin did- back in August 1994) showed up practically everyone under 40. And throw in Jimmy Snuka, still wrestling at the age of 69, and Mae Young, who was a WWE Diva practically until her death in 2014 at age 90, and was in every decade of professional wrestling from the 1930s to the 2010s.\n This is pretty much what Rowdy Roddy Piper\'s last gimmick was all about. He was the awesome old-school guy who showed up every now and then when the young bucks got too big for their britches or forgot what wrestling was supposed to be about, and set them straight.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Radio\xa0\n Bob Kingsley, at age 74 and still going strong as host of Bob Kingsley\'s Country Top 40. He is best known for his 27-year stint helming American Country Countdown. Not counting the times he was substitute host of ACC, Kingsley has been a fixture on country radio for 35 years, introducing the biggest hits from George Jones and Tammy Wynette (in 1978, the year he started) to Blake Shelton and Taylor Swift (today\'s top singers).\n Casey Kasem, host of American Top 40 (and its spinoffs, American Top 10 and American Top 20) was a weekly presence on radio for 39 years \x96 from his late 30s through late 70s! His voice had noticeably changed by the early 2000s, but it was still Casey, and it was cool to many to hear a 77-year-old radio host introduce artists such as Katy Perry, Lifehouse, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, Pink, Fergie and many other urban, contemporary pop and rock artists of the late 2000s decade. (And to think, many people half Kasem\'s age won\'t think of listening to any of the above listed artists\' music. Kasem \x96 old enough to be some of these artists\' great-grandfathers, was still making their music cool.)\n The original panel of I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t A Clue all became this some time during the nineties. Special mention goes to the late host, Humphrey Lyttelton, who told some of the filthiest jokes on the radio well into his eighties.\n John Peel was this late in his 40 year radio career.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Tabletop Games\xa0\n Elminster from the AD&D Forgotten Realms universe. He loves jokes and riddles. He\'s an accomplished dancer who loves ice cream and sliding down banisters. He\'s possibly the game\'s most powerful character, probably the most powerful wizard. (Actually, Elminster is the type who\'s Really 700 Years Old, but for all intents and purposes, he fits the Trope.)\n Similarly, King Boranel of Breland in Eberron.  Also, possibly, Kaius of Karrnath, but since he\'s a vampire, he may not count.\n If the spoilered example counts, Vol absolutely must get a mention here.\n In a twist, Boranel is painfully aware of this trope \u2014 his coolness and the situation the country was in when he rose to the throne has made Breland unusually dependent on him... which wouldn\'t be so much of a problem if he had a equally cool heir or wasn\'t pushing it in years.\n For different reasons, Archangel Michael and Archangel Yves in In Nomine. Michael is the classic version of the trope, the Archangel of War who\'s older than every being but Yves and could kick the ass of anything in creation. Yves is the quieter one, the pleasant old man whom everyone loves (except Michael) who *looks* like a harmless old man but as Archangel of Destiny possesses the secret knowledge of the universe and is feared by most of Hell because they don\'t understand him.\n Sebastian Crenshaw from Mutant Chronicles. Pushing sixty in a world where average life expectancy is forty. One of the solar system\'s best swordsmen, martial artists and assassins, still highly active in his profession, and a stern but fair mentor and father figure to many young trainee assassins. He is also a good-looking, distinguished gentleman, the life of every party and quite the ladies\' man. Oh, also he\'s implied to be Scottish.\n Although he\'s 42, Ezren from Pathfinder is the oldest of the iconic player characters and a very cool guy.\n Warhammer 40,000: Logan Grimnar, Chapter Master of the Space Wolves.\n Any space marine, Chaos Space Marine, Necron, Eldar, or Titan princeps. A universe of cool old guys.\n Well, thats if you consider them "old".\n Aun\'shi of the Tau. One of the few examples of this trope to be only about 38, due to the Tau getting shafted on life expectancy.\n Given the fact that human life expectancy, depending on planet, social status and wealth, can be hundreds of years, it would seem that in 40k, it\'s a little harder to qualify as cool old guy. Most players will come up with someone from their own army who is cool and old. Abaddon, Vect and so on. Still, there is one cool old guy who every 40k player can admit to being the coolest old guy who ever cooled. Yarrick.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theme Parks\xa0\n Epcot has had two over the years: Dreamfinder from Journey into Imagination, who flew around in a Cool Ship collecting thoughts and ideas to create all sorts of new things, and served as The Obi-Wan to his creation Figment until the attraction was overhauled to remove him. Then there was the Sage of Time from the Tapestry of Nations parade, an aged immortal that tried promoting human unity through his Great Millennium Walk that involved lots of cool puppets and Crowning Music of Awesome.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n Advance Wars: The old series had Sensei, who is rumored to be Yellow Comets former legendary commander. The new series have Forsythe, another war hero returned from retirement.\n Sensei\'s coolness is slightly reduced by the fact that he grows weaker in each game. In Super Famicom Wars, where he was still known as Yamamoto, his units were all nigh unbeatable by being a massive 40% more powerful than any normal unit. In Advance Wars 2, his debut as Sensei, only his infantry and battle copters retained his original abilities - and even then only in offensive power, with defense being reduced to average - though he also gained some cool super powers, that still couldn\'t match his original strength. In Advance Wars: Dual Strike, his infantry had also become total weaklings.\n On the other hand, his CO power in Dual Strike summons a hell of a lot of them, making him arguably a Game Breaker on some maps. He is going just a little senile though...\n Also, Javier, a Don Quixote wannabe who can still kick plenty of ass and has the best lines in the game.\n "Charge into the toothy maw! For now is the time for a glorious hindspanking!"\n "This day shall be the greatest of days, unless tomorrow is even greater!"\n Odin and Tor Anderson in Alan Wake might be crazy, but that\'s part of what makes them cool. The other part is that they\'re retired rock stars from the band Old Gods of Asgard. They still have a stage with working pyrotechnics at their farm, they have a Viking longboat in their barn, they changed their names to Odin and Tor, and they make their own moonshine.\n At one point, Odin comments on the events in Bright Falls and their own craziness, saying "It takes crazy to know crazy!"\n Not crazy, but still cool is Pat Maine, the town\'s radio host and a retired cop, who calls out FBI agent Nightingale on his reckless pursuit of Alan - while on the air.\n Assassin\'s Creed:\n Mario Auditore from Assassin\'s Creed II. Ezio\'s uncle acts as The Obi-Wan and is the one who teaches him how to be an assassin and helps him throughout the entire game.\n Ezio himself can count for this by end of Assassin\'s Creed: Brotherhood. He\'s 49, likely the most skilled assassin in Italy  and Grand Master of the Assassin Order in Rome in a time where the life expectancy was within the late 40s to early 50s. By the time of the sequel, Assassin\'s Creed: Revelations, he definitely counts as a cool old guy.\n Revelations also features Altair being the Memetic Badass we\'ve come to know him as well into old age.\n Augus from Asura\'s Wrath.\n Baldur\'s Gate\'s Keldorn. Probably in his 50s at least, greying, a bit creaky, yet goes out and smites evil arse with a 2 handed sword and plate mail (his default equipment).\n It is hard to be lawful good and cool at the same time, but he manages it perfectly. The fact that he is the only NPC that can use the uber-paladin sword Carsomyr is just gravy.\n His interactions with Anomen (lawful neutral, thinks he\'s lawful good) frequently take the form of a Take That at Knight-Templarism and/or Lawful Stupid, the basic message being "if you\'re not awesome, you\'re doing it wrong".\n Gorion, too. Admittedly he\'s dead for most of the time and as such mainly appears in various flashes of the past, and his big Dead Man Writing is ruined when he\'s apparently retconned to have lied about the PC\'s mother. But the picture gathered from other characters is that he used to be an active adventurer who probably saw a lot during his life, and had even faced a dragon and lived to tell the tale, leaving it with a few scars. And apparently he used to tell Imoen and the PC stories about everything between heaven and earth, and would hang out with canon \xfcber-characters like Khelben Arunsun and Elminster Aumar. When we actually see him for a moment at the very beginning, he defends his foster child against the Big Bad and his minions and ultimately sacrifices himself, unwaveringly telling them to step aside if they want to remain unhurt and then eliminating all the three minions in about one round each before facing off hopelessly against the Big Bad himself until he\'s cut down.\n Bastion is a good example of this, featuring Rucks as a badass cowboy/former special ops, with a voice that can only be described as audio erotica.\n Master Naguri from Bujingai. He\'s first introduced as he tosses a stone column at his student, Lau, to test his skills. He then proceeds to dodge all of Lau\'s attacks, calling them terrible. Keep in mind, Lao is capable of Dual Wielding Big Fancy Swords, casting magic, and gliding through the air.\n The Castlevania series has Julius Belmont, who is noticeably older than the cast of the rest of the cast of both Sorrow games.  Technically, Arikado/Alucard is much older. He lampshades this by commenting to Soma that "Growing old is a terrible thing," when he is too winded to fight after breaking a dark barrier. This still doesn\'t stop him from kicking ass in the bonus Julius Mode of both games.\n Better still, in  his fight in Aria of Sorrow, he can use the Grand Cross and it makes parts of the castle crumble, and claims to have been holding back despite  being That One Boss for some people, and this is only using subweapons after halfway into the fight. In Dawn, he is bested by Dario, some fire punk foe, but only because he can\'t seal his dark power. The badass part is that Julius has dealt with sealed enemies before, except he\'s just beaten the shit out of them before they can regenerate. That\'s how awesome he is.\n Dragon Age:\n In Dragon Age: Origins, Duncan, the Warden-Commander of Ferelden.\n In Dragon Age: Origins \x96 Awakening, if Teryn Loghain was spared and forced to join the Wardens during Origins, it seems he\'s mellowed out into one of these.\n Garth from Fable II. The first time you see him, he\'s fighting against the frakking Commandant. And he\'s not doing too badly.\n Fallout:\n Fallout features Harold, a 90 year old mutated human known for his sense of humor and ability to survive. Harold makes appearances in Fallout 2 and 3 as well.\n Fallout 2 has John Cassidy, who is in his sixties at the earliest, has a heart condition, a metal plate implanted in his head, a missing eye, and is covered with scars and wrinkles. Nevertheless, he\'s an outstanding marksman and easily the strongest companion available to the player. His daughter, Rose of Sharon, can fight alongside the player in Fallout: New Vegas.\n Fallout 3:\n Owyn Lyons, Star Paladin Cross, Fawkes, and of course, your father, James. All four have dedicated themselves to helping humanity, though in different ways. There\'s also Desmond Lockheart in Point Lookout, but it\'s really up to you if he qualifies as cool or is just a jerk.\n Herbert \'Daring\' Dashwood is one of the few people in Tenpenny Tower who isn\'t a jerk, and his terminal and radio show reveal he had quite a past. If you release the feral ghouls into the tower, he manages to take some down before being overwhelmed by numbers.\n The Remnants in Fallout: New Vegas, a squad of Enclave veterans with high-tech gear and a shared shady past (of having been in the Enclave) who kick massive amounts of ass once reunited.\n Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VII have characters named Cid, both of him fall under this trope. The VII version is a complete jerkass, though.\n Cid from VII rolls more as a Jerk with a Heart of Gold. He does have some redeeming qualities, after all.\n In a slight subversion, Cid from VII isn\'t even the oldest member of the main cast (he\'s 32, Barrett is 35, Red XIII is 48 note\xa0While Red XIII is 48 years old, he\'s not human, and is basically a teenager), but he acts more like an old man than the other two.\n Auron, of Final Fantasy X fame, fits this trope to a T. He is in near superhuman physical condition, unshaven, and a no-nonsense hardass. However, most of this is fairly unimportant compared to the fact that he\'s already dead in the first place.\n He\'s also only in his 30\'s. Or he was when he died, at least.\n The most imbalanced playable character in the Final Fantasy history: Cidolfas Orlandu, the Thunder God Cid is pretty cool and pretty old.\n For those who haven\'t played Final Fantasy Tactics or haven\'t gotten far enough in to get Orlandu/Orlandeau, he has stat growth and damage numbers far beyond what most other classes will ever get in his initial class, begins with a sword that Hastes him, and comes with all of Agrias\'s, Gaffgarion\'s, and Meliadoul\'s sword skills.\n Maat from Final Fantasy XI, the one NPC who will beat you into the ground when you first fight him. In Wings of The Goddess, you can see him hold off advancing Beastmen armies by himself.\n Cyan demonstrates that not every RPG swordsman is a wangsty teenager, Word of God puts his age around 50-something. Strago could also count, but he\'s old enough to be more of a Badass Grandpa.\n Galuf from Final Fantasy V is a 60-year-old man who was one of the four Warriors of Dawn, who had sealed the Big Bad prior to the game. Not only is he a strong warrior and a king, but he\'s not above making fun of his younger friends and spouting horrible, wonderful puns. Not to mention the fact that he may be the only game character ever to have been able to continue fighting while at 0 freakin\' HP, right before a Heroic Sacrifice!\n Sazh is the oldest of the playable cast of Final Fantasy XIII excluding Vanille and Fang and happens to be the most stable and level-headed of the heroes.\n The resident Bad Ass Mayor of Final Fight, Mike Haggar is the epitome of this trope. Pushing 60 and he is more than able to throw down with Pro Wrestlers, Super Villains, Evil Dictators and even Galactus!!! When was the last time your mayor fought off the eater of worlds?\n Fire Emblem games will always have a couple of Cool Old Guys. Often they\'ll be an Old Retainer to the protagonist or an Older Enemy General who eventually gets recruited to the protagonists cause.\n Athos the Archsage from Fire Emblem 7. More than 1000 years old and still quite the Eccentric Mentor, aside of being one extremely powerful magic user.\n In FireEmblem 7 Marcus (in his 40s) is not only thought of as one badass Cool Old Guy ingame, but he\'s also viewed as practically required for getting a high ranking in the games hard mode. Despite being a Jagen character, Marcus also has high enough growths to remain serviceable throughout the game. In Fire Emblem 6, Marcus( now in his 60s) is more of a classic Jagen but is still needed to beat the games Hard Mode.\n Tauroneo tends to lean this way, despite his tendency to stay away from any conversations in Path of Radiance. However, he truly becomes part of this trope in Radiant Dawn, showing just how wise and awesome he is. He also tends to be one of the best endgame Generals/Marshals. That makes him a Badass, too, as he\'s shown to mow through enemies with relative ease throughout the games. Given his look, he is likely in his mid-50s.\n Basilio gets treated this way in Fire Emblem Awakening by the army, even to the point of being nicknamed "Gramps". Yet, Basilio only looks like he\'s in his 30-40s at most. Gregor is a more accurate example, he\'s visibly middle aged, and is a worldly sellsword who spends most of his Support Conversations giving advice to other characters and joking around. He also has a Russian accent and Blunt Metaphors Trauma that will trick a player into thinking he\'s dumber than he actually is at first.\n Front Mission has Alder Weiss, a good mercenary who\'s a little full of himself and yet a no-nonsense character.\n Malcolm Corley in the LucasArts Adventure Game Full Throttle: Not only is he the owner of Corley Motors, the last remaining domestic motorcycle manufacturer, but he\'s spent a significant amount of his youth on the back of a motorcycle, and gets along particularly well with his customers, sharing anecdotes from the \'glory days\'. It\'s a shame to see him die at the hands of his greedy second-in-command about a third of the way through the game.\n General Luft from the Galaxy Angel gameverse.\n Gears of War: Colonel Hoffman has only a Vague Age, but he\'s definitely aged. He still is capable of kicking ass like a boss.\n Golden Sun:\n Kraden isn\'t a combatant but a Gentleman and a Scholar who provides a great deal of plot exposition, but is still ridiculously popular with the fandom, to the point of being worshipped as a deity by a fan forum called the Temple of Kraden, having a Fanon Christmas-equivalent holiday named for him, and being the subject of several hoax cheats to unlock him as a player character.\n In Dark Dawn, not only has Kraden\'s aging been slowed to the point of Immortality (albeit the rather unfortunate Age Without Youth variety), but some of his Memetic Badass status has leaked into the universe, with multiple characters respecting him as a Determinator who will reach his destination regardless of the traps, monsters, and labyrinths in his way (and this is accurate; he travels through a war zone to join you!).\n King Hydros of Lemuria is also this in-universe, as Piers mentions to the party in The Lost Age that he is not feared but respected by his people for his tremendous age and wisdom (in a nation of Really 700 Years Old people).\n And another in Dark Dawn; over the last thirty years, Briggs went from a youngish pirate and new father to a gray-haired oldster. He has not grown any less badass. It doesn\'t last.\n In the Growlanser series Hien and Dixon from Wayfarer of Time and Alfred Burns from Dual Darkness embody this trope.\n Jolee Bindo in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. He is a very Cool Old Guy , who feigns deafness and senility but who is still a competent fighter and dispenser of sage advice.\n And he\'s voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.\n Also, Masters Vrook and Vandar.\n And Sion (still can whip your ass with a lightsaber at around 1,000 with a barely functional body. Just imagine him in his prime).\n And three of the five lost Jedi Masters (Atris and Kavar don\'t look old enough).\n Canderous Ordo also counts. As of the first game, he\'d been kicking ass for forty years. Second game, he\'s pushing 65, is the only humanoid in the party Exile can\'t cross-class (and doesn\'t NEED to), helps put the smack down on two Sith Lords, and is still kicking righteous ass as Mandalore the Preserver, setting the stage for his people to become Republic \'allies\'\' for the next century or two. All with a bone-dry wit, and surprisingly poetic descriptions of his past battles.\n Bill from Left 4 Dead, an old Vietnam war vet who constantly has a cigarette hanging from his mouth and a witty remark ready for his younger, upstart fellow survivors. One of the lines you can hear him say as you mow down zombie after zombie is "I\'ll see peace back on Earth if I have to kill every single one of these bastards with my bare GOD DAMN hands!"\n"I was too old for this shit fifteen years ago."\n Lufia:\n Randolph, bodyguard of Princess Melphis in Lufia: The Legend Returns. He may be a feeble old man, but he\'s the party resident BFS wielder. Boost up his speed and he\'ll become the party\'s top Lightning Bruiser.\n Dekar, by the time of Lufia The Ruins Of Lore. Twenty years after his earlier adventures, he\'s still out investigating threats to the world. Despite the others poking fun at his age and his wisdom, he pulls his weight quite handily.\n Despite being Demoted to Extra, Lexis in Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals gets a much larger role as the eccentric Mad Scientist helping out and guiding the party.\n Mass Effect:\n Wrex and Mordin are both cool and deadly guys old by their species\' standards. Wrex is somewhere between 1000 and 1500 when natural Krogan longevity is a spot over 1000. However, as the game gladly points out to you, very few krogan die of old age) and Wrex is not one to die from anything else. Mordin is over 40, which is rare for his species.\n Zaeed Massani and Admiral Hackett are human examples, both having quite the lot of badassery under their belts and quite the facial scars to testify to it. Zaeed is somewhat younger than he looks though.\nJacob: If they make old guys any tougher than that, I\'d like to see it.\n Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 is depicted as a badass graying elder, capable of kicking as much ass as he did in earlier games. Although he isn\'t actually that old, he has supposedly aged prematurely because of the primitive cloning method used to create him.\n Then again, the games do have a very high concentration of cool old guys. Revolver Ocelot is in his sixties and the best gunslinger and plan user in the world. An extreme example is The End, \'the father of modern sniping\', who\'s over a hundred and looks it, but is still capable of leaving a man a third his age in his dust, while carrying a sniper rifle.\n \u014ckami has a dojo in 3 areas, all run by the same guy, who goes by Onigiri Sensei. He barely looks like he\'s capable of anything at first, but then he pulls a 180 (rather literally) and becomes a kickass old instructor.\n Dallas from PAYDAY: The Heist is the oldest robber of the crew, being in his mid forties. During his time, he managed to turn two mob groups against each other so he could profit from them and then managed to evade both groups for several years after they discovered they were tricked. Dallas also staged a heist on a freight liner containing weapons once he came out of hiding. Once he teamed up with the rest of the crew in the game, he can fend off waves of cops and SWAT units while robbing banks, jewelry stores, and a senator\'s apartment while not being slowed down by his smoker\'s lung.\n Pok\xe9mon Red and Blue: Professor Oak. Wait, what? Well, in the Adventures/Special manga, at least - Oak actually competes in the Pokemon League, and beats Blue, and without his lab-coat, he looks surprisingly fit for someone his age. The games themselves note that Oak was a top-class trainer before switching professions, roughly around the level of the Elite Four, since he was friends with Agatha.\n With the use of a cheat device, or a branch of the Mew Glitch, you can unlock a Dummied Out battle with Professor Oak, where he has some of the most powerful Pokemon in the game, his strongest equaling Mewtwo and their levels on average being the same as the Champion\'s if not higher. His Pokemon? Tauros, Exeggutor, Arcanine, Gyarados, and the fully evolved starter that wasn\'t picked. All of them are amongst some of the most powerful Pokemon of the first generation. The guy\'s a straight-up badass.\n Also, several Gym leaders from the anime are cool old guys. Blaine/Katsura, Pryce/Yanagi (once he gets defrosted when  his long-lost Piloswine returns), Juan/Adan and Spenser/Ukon come to mind...\n Pok\xe9mon Colosseum introduces a Trainer type called Fun Old Man. Eagun qualifes too (more so in the sequel).\n The kooky mystic in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando.\n While we\'re on the subject, it would be criminal not to mention Orvus and Azimuth. Both majorly cool characters, both capable of incredible things\u2014 they are, respectively,  former Senior Caretaker of The Great Clock note\xa0"A marvel of science and sorcery located in the exact center of the universe! ...Give or take fifty feet." and a Four-Bolt Magistrate for the Lombax Praetorian Guard and an Elder Councilman for the Center for Advanced Lombax Research.\n Both male teachers from the Rival Schools series, Hideo Shimazu and Hayato Nekketsu, qualify for this by simply being Badass Teachers.\n Zimos from Saints Row: The Third. He is the oldest pimp in Steelport, has Autotune on his voice box, and even manages to get one of the DeWynter sisters in bed. And he maintains very high standards of working conditions for his girls to contrast the Syndicate\'s straight up Sex Slavery. For an old guy, he sure has a lot of swag.\n The first two Shadow Hearts games play this straight with Zhuzhen and Gepetto, who are eccentric but powerful mages, and provide invaluable information on the occult to Yuri and the Na\xefve Newcomer female leads. From the New World plays with it, by making its Cool Old Guy character a quite possibly insane ninja/US Secret Agent who, despite technically fitting the trope, isn\'t cool in any imaginable sense of the word.\n Yes he is.\n Not to mention Roger Bacon and Albert Simon, though not playable, are still way cool.\n Shadowrun Returns\n The Dragonfall campaign has Dietrich, the Kreuzbasar Crew\'s shaman and former punk rock frontman. He\'s been actively kicking ass since at least the Night of Rage, 15 years before time the game is set in. He\'s also following an idol that drives him to take on ever greater and more dangerous enemies. All that in the shadows of Berlin, where life tends to be nasty, brutish and short.\n The Director\'s Cut of Dragonfall adds Herr Hasenkamp, the accountant  and assassin of a local loan shark. Sent along on a run to keep an eye on the player  and kill them once the job is done he\'s a literal Badass Grandpa. Should the player manage to come to an agreement with him in the end, he\'ll mention being grateful that he\'ll get home just in time to read a bedtime story to his grandkids...\n SoulCalibur\n Edge Master, Voldo, and Cervantes.\n Splinter Cell\'s Sam Fisher, an ex-Navy SEAL working as an international spy, acts as this. That is, despite starting the series as a fourty-seven year old Navy vet, he still has the capacity to prevent world wars:\nGrim: It looks like a laser grid just came online. Fisher: Lasers? Lasers are so\u2014 Grim: Nineties? Fisher: I was going to say Seventies. Can you please stop making me feel so old? Grim: Got bad news for ya Sam: you are old.\n And again five minutes later:\nGrim: Welcome to the wi-fi era. Sam: Remember: you\'re saying that to a guy from the era of hi-fi. Grim: Hi-fi? As in, like, high in fiber? Sam: Ugh... Don\'t put me in adult undergarments yet, kid.\n Gouken from Street Fighter IV.\n Suikoden has TONS of badass old guys (and women). Georg Prime grows to be a badass old man in Suikoden II. For Suikoden III, Geddoe\'s main party consists of mostly old badasses (himself, Joker and Ace). Suikoden IV has Elenor and Lino, while Suikoden V has Galleon and Raja. And these consist of the generally self-proclaimed old. This game has a fruitful bounty of badass adults.\n Lt. Colonel Daitetsu Minase from Super Robot Wars Original Generation captain of the Hagane. Also Major Kai Kitamura.\n Kai isn\'t actually all that old, however, Rishu Togo definitely counts, being an old swordsman who designed the Type 0\'s sword, and trained both Zengar and Bullet, and also on at least one occasion cut bullets out of the air. You even get to use him as a pilot in one of the PS2 OG games.\n A playable 20-40 throwing the 15-18 Competence Zone out of balance is a staple of the Tales series.\n Klarth F. Lester, Phantasia\n Kongman Bruiser, Destiny\n Fog, Eternia\n Loni and Harold, Destiny 2\n Regal and Kratos, Symphonia\n Eugene Gallardo, Rebirth\n Wil Raynard, Legendia\n Jade Curtiss, Abyss\n Jade plays with this a bit. He\'s only 35, but likes to play up his age to try and get out of any heavy lifting.\n Ricardo Soldato, Innocence\n Raven, Vesperia\n Innes Lorenz, Hearts, as well as Really 700 Years Old Kunzite\n Malik Caesars in Graces.\n Rowen J. Ilbert in Xillia, who at 62 years old is the only one in the list that is actually old in the traditional way.\n Most of the characters from Team Fortress 2, with the exception of the Scout and possibly the Pyro, appear to be in the late 40\'s, early 50\'s range, making them an entire cast of Cool Old Guys. It\'s lampshaded by Heavy in the Mann vs. Machine mode:\nHeavy: I am getting too old and too giant for this.\n Heihachi from the Tekken games. By the fifth one, he\'s a grandpa who can punch Terminators in half and survive an explosion that hurls him several kilometers away. Without any medical attention, mind you.\n And he launches enemies into space on a rocket. Not only is the guy impossible to kill, he\'s got style.\n No mention of Wang? He\'s 104 in 5 and 6, and is in perfect fighting condition. He\'s also one of the good guys, unlike Heihachi. He even gets the respect of Feng with his skill.\n Saisyu Kusanagi in The King of Fighters \'98. He has much of Kyo\'s overconfidence but greater knowledge of combat, so it\'s justified.\n Joel, the main protagonist of The Last of Us. His hair and beard may be starting to gray and he\'s a little past his prime, but he\'s still a tough-as-nails survivor who certainly knows how to bash teeth in, from human and infected alike.\n Usami "Bear Sensei" Kyojin of Majikoi is something of a parody. He\'s only 35 years old and yet is relentlessly mocked by his students for being an old man, and he himself frequently describes himself as middle aged. What makes this even more ridiculous is that a large chunk of the cast is actually older than him, making all of the talk about his age even more ridiculous.\n Elder Keeper Artemus of the Thief series. He\'s more of a Non-Action Guy and The Obi-Wan / surrogate father figure to the protagonist, but he\'s a Badass Bookworm and master of stealth nonetheless.\n Specifically, Artemus is able to outsneak the protagonist, who is able to outsneak basically everyone in the organization that prides itself in never being seen.\n Uncharted\'s Victor "Goddamn" Sullivan, or Sully for his friends. By the time of the third game he is sixty years old, and he can still run, climb, fight, shoot, and woo as well as a man half his age.\n Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume has enough Cool Old Guys to make them a subject of an amusing scene in Seraphic Gate.\n Dandy-J from Waku Waku 7 is a cross between Indiana Jones and Joseph Joestar, how could he be anything but?\n In Mortal Kombat X, the 25-year Time Skip applies this Trope to Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero, Kenshi, and Jax. (Maybe Kano too.)\n Anduin Lothar from the Warcraft franchise. Not only was he a Badass Grandpa who led The Alliance in a world war, but he serves as a kind of Big Brother Mentor to Khadgar in Warcraft: The Last Guardian, showing much more level-headedness and wisdom than his own King.\n In World of Warcraft, Tirion Fordring. A retired man living in a hut until the player shakes him up, at which point he reforms an order of paladins, redeems an army of death knights, and leads an army to some godforsaken corner of the world to bring judgment to a Physical God who threatens all life. Also, he carries a huge magical sword forged from the shard of a dead Energy Being angel with one hand.\n Drek\'thar in the same game. He\'s so old he needs a wheelchair, he\'s blind, he has seizures...and he can STILL kick a raid group\'s ass. Even if you ignore the Alterac Valley version of him, he still predicted the Cataclysm and yelled at the people who ignored him.\n Cairne Bloodhoof. Despite dying he still almost kicks the ass of the son of one of the most famous heroes of the Horde, and he arguably would have won if  Magatha hadn\'t poisoned Garrosh\'s weapon.\n Archbishop Benedictus. Old man, looks weak and decrepit, is a non-fighting priest. That doesn\'t sound cool at all, right? Well, in Cataclysm,  he allies with the evil Aspect of Death, becomes the Twilight Prophet dedicated to wiping out all life, enslaves a blue dragon princess, creates a monster so awful that not even the four dragonflights can take it out without help from Thrall, and eventually faces down Thrall himself and the players to try and recapture the Dragon Soul for his master, Deathwing.\n Dr. Raymond Shen, head engineer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Not only is he responsible for building a lot of really cool stuff (the best of which, in his own opinion, is the Firestorm), he\'s the voice of caution and reason in the Freudian Trio, sometimes coming across as the Only Sane Man in the whole project. And during the alien\'s attack on XCOM HQ, he is shown surviving a machine blowing up right next to him.\n Shaojie "Chilong" Zhang from the Slingshot [DLC is a former member of the Chinese Triad who defected to join XCOM. In his first appearance, he one-shots a moving Sectoid with a pistol and then joins you as (probably) the highest-ranked soldier at that point. He\'s also a good candidate for psychic potential due to his high Will, and hence may possibly even be the soldier who pulls a Heroic Sacrifice at the end of the game.\n Brother-Sergeant Sidonus of the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. He\'s been an Ultramarine for 200 years, has seemingly Seen It All and reacts with appropriate dry humour, lost his arm in battle against the Tyranids and part of his face in battle against the Eldar, and slits a Bloodthirster\'s throat with his chainsword, though sadly he gets killed shortly afterwards.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n Mr. Bear from Achewood, a sharp-witted old pub owner with a broad range of knowledge, who in one story arc handily beat all the younger characters in a contest to see who was the most Badass.\n In Commander Kitty, Morris edges into the "mentor" variant of this trope when he helps Mittens find his self-confidence. Subverted when he realizes that Mittens\' newfound hyper-competence threatens to obviate every other single member of the cast.\n Donovan Deegan isn\'t as old as some of the other guys on this page, but he probably qualifies, considering he\'s the father of 3 full-grown men. And he\'s certainly cool, always upbeat and sociable. Plus he\'s an awesome swordsman who\'s pulled some pretty badass stunts (such as slicing his initials into one Jerkass\'s pant seat). And he can play an electric guitar (which is actually a normal guitar powered by lightning magic, which is all sorts of badass).\n Baron Klaus Wulfenbach from Girl Genius.\n Thaco from Goblins. He is literally old enough to be the other characters\' father. He \'\'\'\'\'is\'\'\'\'\' the father of one of them. In his first introduction, he was sitting in the \'retirement hut\' with two other goblins \u2014 one blind from cataracts and one who shakes so much he can\'t walk without two canes. Not to mention that his name is a reference to Advanced Dungeons Dragons Second Edition, which is apparently a good way in the past in the game world \u2014 at least one generation ago \u2014 and which he was apparently alive to see.\n Dr. Disaster from Gunnerkrigg Court. How many teachers\' dramatic entrances are greeted with cheers from the students? Bob Sutton the gardener, who chuckled at Renard\'s jab about Ysengrin\'s "terrifying skills of gardening". As we discover later, he\'s the one who regularly handles some consequences of this \u2014 successfully. Also, he always shows good sense of humor and good sense in general.\n Sul, the main character in Kiss Wood, who doesn\'t let age get the better of him. He manages to break out of a huge prison complex and walk across a desert whilst caring a child on his back - only to find out he can\'t save both of them and sacrifices himself.\n Mob Ties has Papa-san, the head of one of the few decent Yakuza clans in Tokyo. He\'s friendly, intelligent, devoted to his daughter, and is the first person to truly realize just how badass  Sidney Burns truly is, and is the only person man enough to actually confront him about why he is so badass in the first place. Of course, given that Papa-san was quite the badass himself in his younger days, that last part is understandable.\n Both Tagons from Schlock Mercenary (the captain is well into his 40s, turning 49 in the Credomar plot-arc).\n Tales of the Questor has the Eldest. He\'s the oldest Racconan alive and is a fun-loving chap who can not give a tinker\'s damn what anyone else thinks about anything by virtue of age. He gleefully gets into pie-eating contests and manages to tell old war stories to the youngsters in ways that keep them interested and clamoring for more. He is also one of the few people who is openly and vocally supportive of Quentyn.\n Quentyn\'s dad is also a prime candidate, even moreso than the Eldest. Pretty much his every appearance turns into either a Crowning Moment of Funny or Crowning Moment of Heartwarming. Add to that the fact that he can still match his son the professional warrior-mage on the training field in spite of being significantly older and a professional melon farmer and he has some pretty solid Bad Ass credentials too.\n Dan McNinja, father of the titular character of The Adventures of Dr. McNinja.\n Mrs. Primrose from The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!! Seemingly a cute and chubby little old lady, she\'s an agent employed by an ancient civilization of dragons, and owns a suit of Bubblegum Crisis-style power armor with which she can fly into space.\n Lord Shojo from the Order of the Stick. Even Belkar thought he was cool.\n Yeah, but it was mostly because he ordered paladins to clean his cat\'s litterbox.\n So? Anybody who orders gets paladins to clean a cat\'s litterbox has to be pretty cool.\n O-Chul is probably old enough to count, too. Bad-ass enough to resist torture for months while gathering useful information, then escape armed only with a metal bar, he\'s another example of successfully being Lawful Good and awesome.\n General Tarquin, ruler of the Western Continent  and Elan\'s father.\n Rocky\'s \'Grampy\' from Too Much Information. He\'s got a black belt in 3 different martial arts, has fought in 2 different wars, has traveled the world as an adventurer-archeologist, and taught English in inner-city schools. While the rest of the cast are stuck working their way out of a Love Dodecahedron, he hits it off with Cool Old Lady and borderline Manipulative Bastard Rosa Cartman - who, other than being RIDICULOUSLY good-looking for her age, owns a multimillion-dollar corporation. While the young \'uns are still trying to figure their way out of Dysfunction Junction, he hooks up with her, gets laid (on their first date, no less), and elopes with her within weeks.\n Horse-Man from Unwinder\'s Tall Comics: He\'s twenty-something while the main cast are high-schoolers. He\'s also nice enough to treat Unwinder like an equal; Horse-Man is likewise the only person that Unwinder seems to respect.\n Mr. Fuji from Distortion Nuzlocke; he beats up the protagonist\'s abusive dad with a shovel.\n Jerry from El Goonish Shive: In his first appearance. He\'s a very wise, jolly, and calm guy who takes some time out of his death ritual to offer some wisdom to three girls he\'s never met before. Upon learning of Susan\'s previous encounter with immortals, he even swears to try and pay off the debt that the immortals owe her (despite not being personally involved). As he puts it:\n"Immortals owe you something. I\'m here and have pointy ears. May as well be me."\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n The aged  Buddhist Shinto priest and Badass Long Robe Kamimura from Broken Saints, who lost his family to the atomic bomb in World War II, making him at least twice as old as any of the other three protagonists.\n Pretty much every over-fifty on Gaia Online counts to some extent.\n Johnny K. Gambino, who started out in the plotline as a major villain and is pretty much just Crazy Awesome in general.\n Edmund, who is BFFs with Gambino, chock full of Battle Butler charm, and suave enough to make perving on Vanessa look gentlemanly. Moonlights as a member of the superhero G-Team whenever the need arises.\n Old Man Logan, also a member of the G-Team and an obvious Wolverine expy.\n Uncle Kin in zOMG!, second-in-command of a ninja clan and devoted relative to his Miko niece.\n And last, but definitely not least, the late Vladimir Von Helson, lord of Gaia\'s vampires, whose sparkly death scene was easily the best thing about MMVII (unfortunately, even sparklepires couldn\'t save MMVII).\n Magus from the Global Guardians PBEM Universe is the most powerful wizard on Earth and the heroic defender of the planet from the sorts of supernatural threats usually faced by Marvel Comics\' Doctor Strange. He\'s 318 years old (though he only looks 70 or so), and acts like a Cool Uncle to the rest of his teammates.\n Some Something Awful Goons:\n GeneSplicer, 43 as of 2009 (that\'s old when you\'re among high school/college students) high school forensics teacher ("Who brought the maggots for the students to \'play\' with? Me!"), who even has an avatar of the creepy old man from Family Guy with the legend "Forums Senior Citizen". Has a wedding ring made of meteorite iron and collects (fake) skulls. Has a bookshelf full of sci-fi props, including one of those mind-eating bugs from The Wrath of Khan in a tank. Makes sock monsters in his spare time, which he gives to his students as prizes. Mrs. GeneSplicer also counts, since she got him some of the skulls as a birthday present.\n Possibly HellBastard, since he mentioned a TV show that GeneSplicer also saw as a kid.\n 50-Foot-Ant (presumably around 50), excellent writer and author of about two dozen Dungeons & Dragons manuals and claims to have witnessed the Ramstein air show disaster and to have a supremely annoying Otherkin relative.\n Someone who claimed to be a World War II veteran who registered to praise Humper-Monkey (age unknown  and possibly 50-Foot-Ant\'s creation) during his tales of the haunted German US Army Base that was once used by Nazis where problem recruits are ditched.\n Tokaii, who was a Chicago cop for a few years during The \'60s. He wasn\'t a Corrupt Cop, but pretty much everyone else was which is why he left despite loving the job. He\'s also been on the some form of internet since 1982.\n Tech Infantry has several, including Admiral Karl Von Shrakenberg, Dr. Icarus Hicks, and Colonel Arthur Clarke. Lwan Eddington also qualifies in the later stories.\n In The Gamer\'s Alliance, there are several cool old guys such as Harrad, Josiah and Waldheim.\n The Nostalgia Critic\'s grandfather. He might have been crazy, but he gets points for being the only family member who Critic has fond memories of.\n Sensei Ito at the Whateley Academy in the fictional Whateley Universe is a Crazy-Prepared Badass Normal who is a tiny old Japanese martial artist capable of taking down virtually every single superpowered student at Whateley. As he demonstrates at the start of every term, in aikido classes. He also has a bit of Magnificent Bastard in him.\n Whateley Academy is rife with Cool Old Guy characters, from sixty-ish Gunny Bardue who runs the ranges, to Security Chief Franklin Delarose, to a number of older teachers who you just know used to be superheroes. Charles Xavier\'s school should be so lucky.\n Brennen in The Once And Future Nerd. A man of more than fifty years of age who is loyal to a fault and strong enough to  beat two men to death using their own skulls as weapons by bashing their heads against each other until there is nothing left but red squishy stuff.\n Noob is set in a MMORPG, so most of the cast seems to be in its twenties to early thirties and a recurring subject matter is the generational gap some players get into with their parents or other people of the older generations due to their prejudice about video games (an immature hobby at best, an anti-social serial killer maker at worst). However, one of the players from the Player Killing-oriented guild is a sweet old man who can pull his weight in battle in the comic and mentions he\'s not the only one playing in his retirement home in the webseries.\n While YouTube Poop is usually the domain of a younger generation (most poopers are in their teens or twenties), noisepuppet stands out as a popular and beloved pooper who is in his 50s.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Iroh of Avatar: The Last Airbender practically embodies this trope. (Though he\'s not a Badass Normal.)\n And his group, the White Lotus Society, is a whole gang of cool old guys.\n "Welcome to Old People Camp!"\n Plus all five30 or so of them reconquer Ba Sing Se, and at least one of them doesn\'t even bend!\n The best part about Uncle Iroh is that you just know that if someone went down the list, and played the "Who Would Win" game, nobody would win against Iroh, because  he\'d offer them all tea, and they\'d end up calmly drinking tea and discussing old people stuff.\n Iroh was trained up to conquer the world. Although he must have had mixed feelings, given the thing with the dragons happened relatively early in his life, he was doing pretty well at that until his son died. His father died the next day. He suspended all his Badass and sank into sleep mode, doing nothing while his little brother usurped him and then following his traumatized nephew around the world being as annoying as possible. Then, One-Man Army.\n Monk Gyatso, Aang\'s Airbending instructor; in his first flashback appearance, he and Aang pie a few of the other monks in order to improve Aang\'s accuracy, and  his skeleton is seen surrounding by dead Fire Nation soldiers (soldiers who had been supercharged by Sozin\'s Comet), which is even more impressive as Airbending is the least lethal of the Bending Arts.\n In The Legend of Korra, Fire Lord Zuko, Iroh\'s nephew, is keeping the tradition alive. Despite being at least eighty years old, he\'s an incredibly powerful bender and shows no hesitation in hunting down the Red Lotus (season 3\'s villains), mostly by himself. Oh, and he rides a dragon.\n Bruce Wayne from Batman Beyond.\n Makes sense, considering he used to BE Batman.\n USED to be Batman? Tell that to his subconscious!\n Terry would like to disagree.\n Batman is Batman is Batman...the Battle for the Cowl in the comics featured at least two, although Machine Gun Jason Batman was out of the running for reader acceptance. Because machine guns.\n Wildcat in Batman: The Brave and the Bold and in Justice League Unlimited. Both are Badass Normal to boot, and don\'t even have Batman\'s level of training or gadgets- just boxing.\n Grandpa Max from Ben 10, especially after he\'s revealed to be a former Man in Black who remembers quite a bit from his old job and still has access to his old gear. Generally of the "dated but loveable personality" type, but swings into "no nonsense" when the situation calls for it... In a nutshell, he\'s a textbook case.\n He\'s the same guy who bosses Snake around, making him even more awesome.\n Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales, serving as a faithful adaption to the comics\' glory.\n Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth from Futurama. For starters, he has a Thug Life tattoo on his back.\n Ol\' Skool from Get Ed, who uses actual old school gear, but can keep up with the kids he mentors, their enemies, and with Mr. Bedlam as well, much of the time.\n Mosey from Horseland and to a somewhat lesser extent, Shep.\n Doc from Invasion America fits the bill nicely, though that series was less plagued by Competence Zone than most.\n Uncle from Jackie Chan Adventures, not only is he the Old Master but he is seen kicking ass as it is needed and will bring pain to those who bring trouble, including the main protagonist.\n Master Oogway in Kung Fu Panda was quite old when he beat one of the most dangerous known martial artists. Master Shifu probably could have replicated the success 20 years later if not for his sentimental attachment to said artist.\n Like his Real Life counterpart, Benjamin Franklin of Liberty\'s Kids.\n From Ni Hao, Kai-Lan, Kai-lan\'s grandfather Ye-ye.\n Detective Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov from Stuart M. Kaminsky\'s series set in Russia. Over fifty when the series started in the \'80s, he is lame from a WWII injury involving a tank, but is a champion weightlifter. He once defeated a thug just by holding him in the air, despite all the thug\'s attempts to get down. (Most of what Rostnikov does isn\'t brawn but brain, though.)\n Secret Millionaires Club has Warren Buffett (voiced by himself) as one who\'s hip to the four students he mentors that form the Club.\n He also knew Jay-Z and Shaquille O\'Neal, and set the Club up to meet them and learn from their business abilitie as well.\n The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles always have Master Splinter to come to for advice and for back-up.\n The TMNT 2012 Splinter advocates Combat Pragmatism and teaches his sons that Honor Before Reason can get you killed. Being a good deal younger than his previous incarnations, this Splinter is much faster and more deadly than in previous series. He even incorporates his mutation into his fighting style, dropping to all fours and fighting like a rat against especially powerful opponents.\n Plato from The Little Flying Bears.\n Cap\'tain K\'nuckles from The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. He beat 100 pirates alone, carried Bubby on his back and sailed in a storm during a fight against 8-Armed-Willy.\n Much like the books they are based on, the older engines such as Edward, Toby and Skarloey usually play this straight in Thomas the Tank Engine, though the show\'s longer run has led to them having more flawed or vulnerable moments than in The Railway Series. Arguably Sir Topham Hatt (aka The Fat Controller) also counts.\n In ThunderCats (2011)\n Court Mage Jaga is the eldest of the titular Cats, but is fully capable of taking on a Walking Tank by his lonesome, mocking a Mook Lieutenant when held prisoner, and getting a few licks in against Big Bad and Sorcerous Overlord Mumm-Ra.\n Anet is the elder of a village of Forgetful Jones Elephant Monks. Wise and kind when focused, but constrained by a need to meditate on any decision, they seem largely useless when an invading army comes seeking a MacGuffin, until Anet leads his people in routing the army and defeating an enemy General barehanded.\n In the original Thunder Cats Lynx-O was the resident Cool Old Guy.\n Ito San from Tokyo Mater, who is an old Japanese car who helps Mater race against the villain Kabuto after being rescued from a ditch and brought back to Japan.\n Jerry in Totally Spies! - on the rare occasion that he\'s personally called into action, he consistently outclasses the Spies themselves.\n He only appears briefly, but there\'s a really Cool Old Guy in the old Looney Tunes short "Porky the Fireman". Porky Pig, who is working as a - what else - fireman climbs a ladder at a burning tenement to save an old guy yelling for help, but the guy tells him, "Never mind me, go save Grandpa" then jumps to safety on his own, using his beard as a parachute.\n Most "old" characters in Transformers tend to be cool old guys. Since they don\'t age like humans, the most common cause of death is war-related and anyone who survives to be really really old probably did so by being really really badass.\n Ratchet in Transformers Animated is definitely a badass, despite sporting a beer gut. He\'s also the team\'s medic, making comparisons to Bones McCoy even more impossible.\n Also Ultra Magnus, especially [when he\'s got his hammer with him.\n Kup in Transformers Generation 1 is definitely a cool old guy, like Animated Ratchet but much less grumpy. Also, in "All Hail Megatron" he gets a bitchin\' robot cigar to chew on.\n Even Ratchet\'s G1 incarnation, who\'s not really intended to represent any extreme of age the way Kup is, tends to get a lot of this trope. His canon appearances as a competent medic and go-to guy paved the way for his interpretation by the fans. Fandom is especially fond of causing him to bludgeon insubordinate/uncooperative patients with wrenches and other tools, go all Doc McCoy even on Optimus Prime\'s aft, and generally act in a lovably codger-y manner, even ascribing him Cool Old Guy traits such as extreme shrewdness and a wrathfully protective nature regarding his crewmates (the young twins Sunstreaker and Sideswipe tend to be at the receiving end of his lectures and fists, more often than not).\n G1 Ironhide was the franchise\'s original Cool Old Guy . His toy card specifically states how he\'s the oldest Autobot, the most likely to break down from outdated parts, but too stubborn and orny to give up and quit fighting. The show just made it better by giving him a Southern grandpa accent to match.\n Vector Prime in Transformers Cybertron is both cool and so old he\'s made of clockwork.\n Scavenger in Transformers Armada was mentor to Optimus Prime.\n The title character of Uncle Grandpa. Anyone who rides a Giant Realistic Flying Tiger is automatically ten kinds of cool.\n Master Fung in Xiaolin Showdown started out a mentor-type, but with the introduction of Mala Mala Jeong, proved he still has plenty of awesome fighting skills in him.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Real Life\xa0\n\n John Quincy Adams was nicknamed "Old Man Eloquent" and served as a member of the House of Representatives and an antislavery advocate until his death at the age of 81. He actually died inside the Capitol Building after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.\n Konrad Adenauer. He had been retired for years, hunted by the Nazis, many times imprisoned, financially broke, and 73 years old when he got elected Chancellor of (West) Germany, supported by all large parties except Communists. Stood for 14 years, throughout the worst of the Cold War, rebuilt the state administration of Germany by himself, practically from scratch, initiated the reparations agreement between Germany and Israel, helped secure the release of the last German POWs from the USSR, and above all gained the entrance of Germany in the nuclear club during the 1950s. It takes some diplomatic hype to ask the cooperation of former enemies in this matter barely 10 years after the War.\n Kheyr ed-Din, a.k.a. "Barbarossa" (not to be confused with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I), was a Barbary pirate who was still fighting sea-battles in his eighties - and kicking righteous ass, too.\n Genghis Khan was still commanding his armies at age 72. Considering the average human lifespan at the time, that\'s pretty impressive.\n King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX of Thailand. He\'s simultaneously the world\'s oldest, richest, and longest-reigning monarch, led his country to democracy in the 1990s, and is really the one stable constant in Thailand\'s notoriously shaky political system (the man has seen sixteen governments go by without a single change to his own office). He\'s also the only monarch in the world to hold a patent (on a water aerator and some rainmaking devices) and an accomplished saxophonist, apparently.\n Fred Astaire took up skateboarding in his seventies and was awarded a life membership in the National Skateboard Society. At the age of 78, he broke his wrist while practicing in his driveway. His comment: "Gene Kelly warned me not to be a damned fool, but I\'d seen the things those kids got up to on television doing all sorts of tricks. What a routine I could have worked up for a film sequence if they had existed a few years ago."\n Tony Benn. An ever-present figure in British politics from his start in 1950 until his death in 2014. Even after retiring from Parliament in 2001, had a talk with Ali G once. Mourned throughout the political spectrum.\n Tom Bergeron, host of The Hollywood Squares, Dancing with the Stars and America\'s Funniest Home Videos. He\'s known for being very laid back and "un-Hollywood" off camera.\n\n Norman Borlaug (1914\x962009). He was a pretty cool dude right to the end.\u25ca He\'s responsible for saving the lives of billions of people through breeding of drought-resistant, disease-resistant crops to feed the world. Check out all his life work here on the Other Wiki.\n\n\n\n David Attenborough is cool enough to go down a hundred feet in a submarine or climb a 100-foot tree while pushing 90, all while maintaining a dapper composure that few men half his age could muster.\n William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Kirk and Spock. Also best friends in real life (albeit starting long after their most famous roles\u2014chiefly because Shatner had been a tremendous dick professionally in the series, but Nimoy helped him come to terms with that and make peace with the rest of the Star Trek cast). And despite being well into their eighties, both are still very active in the Star Trek fandom and the media as a whole (that is, before Nimoy died in 2015).\n Winston Churchill: Because He Never Surrenders.\n Dick Clark. Until his stroke, he still looked so untouched by age that he epitomized his "World\'s Oldest Living Teenager" nickname.\n\n\n Jacques Cousteau, the great aquatic explorer who seemed like the Ancient Mariner himself in his documentaries.\n Walter Cronkite, "The Most Trusted Man in America". Uncle Walter not only brought us "the way it is" night after night, but was a long-time race car driver and expert sailor.\n\n Clint Eastwood is the personification of this trope. At 80-ish years old, he\'s still awesome, is a Memetic Badass, still makes some of the best movies in Hollywood (now more often as the director rather than an actor, with a distinctive visual style and a good reputation for finishing ahead of schedule and always within budget), and still has a great attitude. As a licensed pilot, he apparently still sometimes flies his own helicopter to the studio to avoid traffic. He\'s a veteran of the Korean War, and is a former lifeguard. He\'s also a Friend to All Living Things and has long been involved with animal rescue efforts in California, and he and his wife take care of several rescued animals that they\'ve adopted on their ranch. He\'s also got a talent for music, and in particular is an aficionado of jazz (and his son Kyle is a renowned jazz musician in his own right), as well as Country Music. He\'s also been known to practice meditation every morning since the 1970\'s. And he can still kick your ass easily.\n Roger Ebert (RIP). Although he died at 70 in 2013, not all that old by today\'s standards, he battled cancer for the last decade of his life, and lost his voice to it... but still published movie reviews almost to the end. The fact that his reviews contained equal parts Deadpan Snarker and Sophisticated as Hell, and even coined a few tropes along the way certainly helped.\n Donald Fagen and Walter Becker\n The Reverend Lionel Fanthorpe. Anglican priest, member of Mensa, former writer of Extruded Book Products (which made him a figure of minor legend in the UK SF scene), dan-grade martial artist and weightlifter, biker, investigator of anomalous phenomena. All carried out with an enormous zest for life and a great sense of humour. Your only problem, if you\'re lucky enough to meet him, will be getting him to stop talking...\n Tim Gunn. To the point where Congress recently declared him a national treasure.\n Benjamin Franklin was this by the time of the Revolutionary War.\n Morgan Freeman. Because, you know, he\'s God.\n James Harrison, the "man with the golden arm." His unique blood donations have saved approximately 2 million babies\' lives, and at 74 he\'s still donating a pint of blood as often as he can.\n Jerry Goldsmith.\n Mark Hamill is an avid comic book fan since childhood and has voiced everybody\'s favourite clown psychopath for twenty-odd years now.\n Werner Herzog. Among other achievements, his most recent documentary required him to climb around in a cave with his camera crew, someone once drove by and shot him with a BB gun and he just laughed it off.\n Sammo Hung. A legendary action superstar (and friends with Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao) in Hong Kong action cinema. What\'s even more impressive is that this former Peking Opera player turned actor doesn\'t seem to get any thinner, but could still go toe-to-toe with the likes of much younger action stars such as Donnie Yen and Wu Jing.\n Samuel L. Jackson.\n Lloyd Kaufman, who\'s been making truly independent films for about forty years, and, at 65, he definitely hasn\'t softened.\n Nicely demonstrated by his recent collaboration with The Angry Video Game Nerd.\n A 63 year old man named Fred Kemp protected himself and his wife from a robber by getting him in a rear-naked choke.\n Sir Christopher Lee: Just read the article; actor, commando, secret agent,note\xa0 He\'s mentioned serving in both the Long Range Desert Group and the Special Operations Executive. When filming The Lord of the Rings he was able to tell Peter Jackson the exact sound a man made as they died after being stabbed in the back. heavy-metal singer. That\'s right\u2014heavy metal singer. At age 87. And it\'s epic metal about Charlemagne, at that. And then, at age 90, he participated in another heavy metal album, this one focusing on CHRISTMAS SONGS. You truly have not lived until you hear Dracula/Count Dooku/Saruman singing "Little Drummer Boy" to the sound of heavy metal. On top of that, he released ANOTHER heavy metal album on his 91st birthday in 2013. He passed away in 2015, but remains an inspiration to many.\n Being Saruman the White AND Dracula.\n Did his own stunts in the Star Wars prequels, used a stunt double only when he was supposed to run.\n Stan Lee, as the image on this page indicates. Now in his 90s, Lee, who created most of the Marvel Universe, hands down, not only continues to be involved in creating comic books, but it has become traditional for him to make cameo appearances in movies and TV shows based upon his works. In 20 years there have only been a couple of films and shows in which he failed to appear. He also continues to be a much in demand elder statesman at comic book conventions.\n Kurt Loder for MTV News. Granted he was only 42 when he began to work for MTV, but that was still twice as old as even the second oldest on-screen MTV personality. Despite this he\'s actually MTV\'s longest serving personality because of his trustworthiness and popularity with the young adult crowd.\n Most of the stalwart staff of MAD magazine is pretty well up there but still turning out some top-notch parody. Among them are writers Dick DeBartolo (born 1945), Duck Edwing (born 1934), Mort Drucker (born 1929) and Al Jaffee (born 1921).\n Nelson Mandela, doubled as Badass Grandpa until his health finally failed in the last months of his life.\n William Marshal. He had multiple chances to seize a throne for himself but his honor and loyalty were stronger than the temptation of power. He also suffered from terminal levels of badassery. His most dramatic moment was the battle of Lincoln, as he put down the rebellion against young Henry III (William was Regent). He led the charge against the rebels and fought in the streets until he captured the enemy commanders, with three dents in his quarter-inch-thick steel helm from the fighting. Not bad considering he was 73 at the time. Immediately after that he rode to Dover and stopped the invading French forces there and negotiated a peace.\n Michael McDonald. (02/12/1952 - present); 5-time Grammy Award winning singer and songwriter who has worked with Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers.\n Shigeru Miyamoto. It\'s hard to find a picture of him where he\'s not grinning his ass off with that youthful sparkle of creativity in his eye, and he\'s in his sixties.\n Paul Newman. Aside from being a beloved actor, philanthropist, World War II Pacific veteran, and all-around great guy, he was still racing cars in his seventies.\n\n Don Pardo. Kept rockin\' the opening announcements for Saturday Night Live until he died in 2014 at NINETY-FIVE.\n\n Ron Graham- mathematician and former circus performer who managed to work out a number so big that if you tried to mentally envision it in its entirety your head would collapse into a black hole. Also still doing trampoline somersaults and juggling pins in his eighties.\n The late John Peel fit this trope when he got older. He never settled into a routine of playing his old favorites on another radio station; even up until the very end, he kept his Radio 1 gig of playing new, upcoming acts and making sure that if a demo tape/CD was good enough, it\'d be played on his program, regardless of whether the artist was signed or unsigned.\n Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth\'s husband. Still grills at the age of 90, flew over 5,000 pilot hours by the time he turned 70.\n\n Former US president Ronald Reagan. After being shot, he was wheeled into the hospital...and was still calmly cracking jokes.\n Both Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush have cultivated this image in their post-presidency. Carter became an award-winning peace activist who started a disease-eradication programs and builds homes for the impoverished during his free time. Bush Sr. appears at public events with colorful ties and sock while also taking up the hobby of skydiving despite his old age. Both left office with dismal approval ratings yet are now highly revered by people of all political backgrounds.\n His Excellency, General and President George Washington was a Memetic Badass within his own lifetime and has continued to be ever since. He survived near-death experiences on the battlefield and rallied the troops to keep fighting for independence. Later, the inability of the first Congress to pay the troops\' long-overdue salaries in the aftermath of the war created a situation where angry troops wanted to overthrow Congress and many wanted to convince Washington to lead this coup and become a military dictator, which would have crushed American freedom in its infancy. George Washington refused, and successfully convinced his troops to relent. By doing so, Washington saved the early American republic (for the second time, considering the fact that his military leadership had preserved it during the Revolution), and became the Cincinnatus. Years later, he became the first President and set another important precedent by stepping down after two terms (becoming the Cincinnatus a second time), a precedent followed by all following Presidents except FDR. The early Americans were well aware of Washington\'s status as "the American Cincinnatus", and one of the first veterans\' associations in the United States was named the Society of the Cincinnati in recognition of this fact. This is also where the name of Cincinnati, Ohio comes from. Even Washington\'s archnemesis, King George III of the United Kingdom readily admitted that by giving up power, Washington would deserve the title of greatest man then-currently alive. That\'s right, Washington was so badass that his own archnemesis couldn\'t deny it.\n Mr. Warmth, Don Rickles. He\'s over 87 years old but he can still kick all those younger stand up comedians and insult comics around the curb.\n\n The late Fred Rogers, Friend to All Children and beloved by generations of television viewers.\n Rogers might well be an uber-example; make fun of him on a site like, say, 4chan - generally regarded as the cesspool of the Internet - and the only reason you will not be banned on the spot is because they will thoroughly trash you first. On 4chan. Can\'t get much cooler than that...\n The late Scatman John. Not only did he have to overcome his severe speech impediment (during the height of his success, journalists commented that interviews were difficult due to his constant stuttering), he achieved global success with his numerous dance singles. Did we mention that he was releasing dance songs at the age of 54? While not by any means ancient, at the time dance mixes were something almost exclusively created by the younger generation. Worth noting is said speech impediment invariably contributed to his success.\n Socrates became something of a youth idol in his time, despite being over forty when he began his "gadfly of Athens" phase, to the point that the main charge that led to his execution was "corrupting the youthnote\xa0the unspoken subtext being that they blamed him for corrupting the particular youth Alcibiades, who had caused Athens a lot of pain during The Peloponnesian War (starting with his advocacy for the ill-fated Sicilian expedition and getting worse from there), but because of a general amnesty for events during the war they couldn\'t quite say it outright without ripping open wound that had not yet begun to truly heal.." (Athenian law was more... flexible.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Charlie Watts deserves special mention for making a decades-long marriage, clean living and jazz drumming look cool for 50-plus years.\n Keeping to music, David Bowie has probably been this since he marked his 50th birthday with an all-star concert at Madison Square Garden in 1997, but then he released The Next Day in 2013, which was his first album in nearly 10 years and an international success with critics and music buyers. He hasn\'t performed live since 2007, so with this feat he effectively made an outright, out-of-the-blue comeback at the age of 66.\n Jim Steranko. Instantly recognizable at any comic book convention in his double-breasted suits, tinted aviator glasses, and wave of silver hair, Steranko continues a lifetime of being a Cool Guy, having been an escape artist, early rock-n-roll musician, ground-breaking comics artist, and collaborator of Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola. In a recent interview, he revealed that he only sleeps two hours a day and only eats one meal of raw fruits and vegetables. Interviewer Jonathan Ross asked him, "You know how mad that makes you sound?" He replied, "Yeah, I don\'t give a damn." Ross concludes his article by expounding, "I believe it when he tells me he still runs miles every day, pumps iron, and fornicates blissfully like a man a third his age."\n Sir Patrick Stewart, along with his good friend Sir Ian McKellen. Although they were both Shakespearean actors with long careers, they really only got to know each other well in the 2000s (when they first played together, in the X-Men films)\u2014and promptly found that they actually got along together rather well, much to the delight of their (mostly much-younger) fans. They\'ve embraced technology and interesting roles, as well as keeping up their friendship and keeping the world posted on it via Internet.\n\n\n\n Tamerlane/Temur Lang/Timur Lenk, the fourteenth century conqueror. Absolutely brutal, but notable for surviving being a great, empire-building conqueror, outliving two and a half (the third son suffered crippling brain damage) of his four sons. When he was about seventy, his favorite grandson stalled out invading India, so he rode out and gave the kid a hand, sacked Delhi, and went back to Qandahar. He died at seventy-four in the process of gearing up to invade China. And he probably would have won, too.\n Nobuo Uematsu. Singlehandedly wrote and composed ALL the Final Fantasy songs from FFI to FFX. Is also in a metal band called the Black Mages.\n Norio Wakamoto definitely counts amongst the Seiyuu circles.\n\n Many dub voice actors for anime are both old and beloved among their fans, including Wendee Lee (54), Jamieson Price (53), Michael Mcconnohie (63), and Steve Blum (54), who spearheaded the "#BringBackToonami" movement.\n Tom Waits is over 60 years old, yet has lost none of his grizzled, husky-voiced charm.\n The one, the only Sir Terry Wogan. For ages, the only reason many tuned into the Eurovision Song Contest, and his radio audience transcended age boundaries (which is why there\'s a "TYG/Terry\'s Young Geezers" counterpart to the "TOG/Terry\'s Old Geezers" fanbase). He too broke new artists on his Radio 2 program, from Katie Melua to the late Eva Cassidy to Jamie Cullum.\n Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a Japanese businessman who lived to be 93, having survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in 1945.\n All the astronauts from the US space program, as interviewed in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon.\n Buzz Aldrin in particular. One day, while walking with his daughter, he was confronted by a crazy conspiracy theorist who kept loudly and rudely claiming that the Moon landing had been faked, and called Aldrin "a coward, and a liar, and a thief." Aldrin promptly responded by punching the conspiracy theorist in the face... at the age of 72.\n Later, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Buzz teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video, "Rocket Experience." Proceeds from video and song sales went to benefit Buzz\'s non-profit foundation, Share Space.\n Once introduced himself at a speaking event as Buzz Lightyear, and also appeared As Himself on The Simpsons in a role where he mercilessly mocked himself.\n NASA Scientist: ...and Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon!\n Aldrin: Second comes right after first!\n (Long pause as everyone save Aldrin looks around awkwardly)\n Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being, better known as Kirby, won Westminster when he was 8. That\'s old for a dog. This was the same year he won the canine Triple Crown. However his pure canine awesome didn\'t stop. When he was 14 he came out of retirement to win (for the fourth time) Papillon Club of America\'s National Speciality Show. This made him both the oldest dog to win this title and the dog with the most wins of said title. He died two years later at 16.\n Sir\u25ca Elton\u25ca Hercules John.\n Although he isn\'t exactly "old" quite yet, as of his 50th birthday, Jon Bon Jovi is on his way to becoming this trope. At 50, he\'s still very athletic (apparently, he still has abs), recently started up the JBJ Soul Foundation to help provide quality food and housing to poor people in his home state of New Jersey, and unlike some rockers, he\'s still married to his first wife, who happens to be his high school sweetheart. Oh, and he and his band (who are also on their way to becoming Cool Old Guys) can still put on awesome concerts, and generally tickets for their tours get sold out extremely quickly.\n Baseball\'s Yogi Berra is definitely this trope. During the 1940\'s, 50\'s, and 60\'s, he was one of the greatest players in the game. He later became a coach, serving as mentor to the new generation of players. Now 88 years old, he still attends the Yankees\' Spring Training to dispense wisdom to the current players. He\'s known for being extremely friendly and gregarious, and lots of people in baseball think of him as a Cool Uncle. Oh, and the many amusing malapropisms he\'s uttered over the years, known appropriately as Yogi-isms, always result in a Crowning Moment of Funny. In short, Berra is a classy, funny veteran of the game and it can quite safely be stated that he\'s universally loved by fans and players alike. And he kept it up until he died in September 2015 at 90.\n\n Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington was still active in both politics and the military up until his death.\n John Cleese.\n Lemmy from Mot\xf6rhead. As of this writing, he\'s almost 68 years old but still playing kick-ass metal music.\n William S. Burroughs died in 1997 at the age of 83... but not before becoming an alternative-subculture icon during the early 1990s.\n The Cardinals\' Stan "The Man" Musial is very similar to the Yogi Berra example above (until the last months of his life, attended all the events he could, still gave autographs and replies to fanmail; also univerally beloved) with one extra detail: at age 90, he was the center of a fan-led grassroots campaign in St. Louis to get him the Congressional Medal of Freedom (the highest honor a U.S. civilian can receive). He received it in January 2011. He\'s possibly one of the finest Real Life examples of a Sacred Cow.\n By the time of Musial\'s death in January 2013, he\'d given so many autographs away that it is pretty much monetarily worthless. Think about that.\n\n Ronnie James Dio (R.I.P.) was definitely this.\n\n Most males from the Dutch series Golden Oldies are this. They are in a choir that actually sings modern day rock music, despite being over 70\u2014 some even being in their late 80s.\n Ditto for the aptly-named Young@Heart choir, who has an average age of 80 and were famously documented in a film named after them.\n\n The Man, the Myth, the Legend, Chuck Norris. 70+ and still going strong.\n\n\n Brian Dewhurst\'s name is familiar to Cirque du Soleil fans \u2014 he originated key roles in two tours (Nouvelle Experience and Fascination), has appeared in several of their film and television productions, and is currently playing the Non-Ironic Clown and crowd favorite Brian Le Petit in Mystere. That he\'s been working in circuses, cabaret, etc. since his teens is not surprising. That he was born in 1932...that\'s another story!\n George Burns built a whole second entertainer career with this trope after the death of his wife, Gracie Allen, and kept it up until his death at 100.\n Ernest Borgnine lived to be 95 and was in full-on Borgnine mode right up to the end.\n Joe Biden combines several traits of your favorite goofy uncle with a sharp wit, occasional verbal gaffes and considerable experience. No wonder one of the petitions on whitehouse.gov is to give him his own reality show.\n\n Max von Sydow has been acting in films since 1947. He played Father Merrin in The Exorcist, among many other roles.\n Pope Francis is a very affable person who refuses to live in the papal apartments in the Vatican (which is one of the last modern examples that still look the part of the Decadent Court), throws out the script quite often when he makes speeches, enjoys interacting with children, and has gone out of his way to help the poor, including feeding the homeless while dressed as an ordinary priest. He\'s also very supportive of environmental protection, very eager to try out new tech and even says that he was perfectly fine with homosexuality.\n Jerry Miculek is a world-class shooter with over ninety titles to his name. He teaches shooting and hosts a series of videos demonstrating various firearms. You can tell that he\'s having as much fun as he can when he\'s showing off high-caliber weapons.\n Lou Reed had ascended to this status by the time he died in 2013.\n Colin Baker. He became The Sixth Doctor on Doctor Who in his forties in 1984... got slammed, fucked by the BBC, given shit scripts, treated like absolute shit, and to top it off, was outright sacked. This didn\'t stop him, however, from playing joining the cast of Big Finish Doctor Who in 1999 to play the Sixth Doctor AGAIN. Except this time people who knew how to write good stores and characters were hired, the stories themselves greatly better, Colin got to play the Doctor how he wanted instead of how the BBC forced him to. He even got to write his own scripts. And today, at age 71, he\'s STILL doing it!!! And regularly visiting conventions and meeting crazed fans.\n The late Shigeru Mizuki, manga pioneer who lived to age 93. He lost one arm in the war. Mizuki popularized Youkai manga, that even profoundly influenced Osamu Tezuka.\n Eugene Levy has been typecast as a Cool Old Guy. Turned 68 in 2014 and is currently starring in a critically praised sitcom called Schitt\'s Creek on the CBC with his son Dan and his fellow SCTV alumnus/best friend (and Cool Old Gal) Catherine O\'Hara.\n\n The late Harold Ramis. Appeared as Egon Spengler in the Ghostbusters flicks at the ages of 40 and 45, appeared as Adam (yes, that Adam) in 2009\'s Year One at the age of 65, and in 2007, while filming Knocked Up with Seth Rogen, Rogen confirmed he and Ramis shared a joint- and Ramis was 63 at the time. Prior to his untimely passing in 2014 Ramis was working on the third Ghostbusters movie with fellow Cool Old Guy Dan Aykroyd and only stopped making movies in 2009 because he fell seriously ill in 2010 and never quite recovered enough to get back to work. RIP, Egon.\n Longtime Today anchors Gene Shalit (b.1926) and Willard Scott (b.1934) fit this. The former continued to rip into movies from 1969 until his retirement, still retaining his Jerk with a Heart of Gold status to this day, and the latter is still on the show as of February 2015 (he retired in December), doing the Smuckers 100th birthdays segment, and remains as lovable and carefree as ever.\n Willard was also a good enough sport to appear as a commentator for VH-1\'s 2005 I Love The Holidays special - at the age of 71. He was the oldest of all the people interviewed for the special.\n Alex Kozinski, a Judge (later Chief Judge) of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is famous for his almost dangerously casual style and frequent and humorous pop-culture references (enabled in large part by the fact that the Ninth Circuit includes California, with all the entertainment industry\'s glorious litigiousness\u2014in Judge Kozinski\'s own words, the Ninth is basically the "Court of Appeals of the Hollywood Circuit"). He first gained national prominence in 2002 with Mattel v. MCA Records, involving the makers of Barbie suing Aqua\'s record company for trademark infringement over "Barbie Girl", resulting in Kozinski (in an opinion issued the day after his 52nd birthday) that opened "If this were a sci-fi melodrama, it might be called Speech-Zilla meets Trademark Kong" and ended with the famous line "The parties are advised to chill." Since then, Kozinski hasn\'t let up.\n\n Sam Waterston. Before his decade-and-a-half long tenure on Law & Order and being on The Newsroom, this versatile Shakespearean actor was seen in movies like the original film version of The Great Gatsby and The Killing Fields, the latter which earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n The late Jerry Orbach. Even though his character, Lenny Briscoe, was a Deadpan Snarker, he on the other hand was a warm, friendly family man and gentleman who was so respected that real-life police officers would give him a ride to wherever he needed to go. Even moreso, given his popularity in many of his roles like Briscoe and Lumiere gave him a certain appeal that audiences still love.\n\n Blues artist Howlin\' Wolf. He was already in his forties during his prime.\n A number of The Muppets personnel, notably Jerry Nelson and Dave Goelz. The former recorded an album at 75, and while suffering from emphysema to boot.

Black and white lived in perfect harmony and ganged up on green."\n\u2014 Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad\n\n"Fantastic" as in "fantasy", not as in "awesome" (i.e., not the way the Ninth Doctor uses "fantastic").\nA subset of the old trick of dealing with thorny issues through metaphor. Instead of having the hero encounter racism between, say, whites and blacks in the American Deep South, or between ethnic Czech and Roma in the Czech Republic, or between Ainu and Japanese, or any other sets of real-world groups, they encounter racism between two-headed aliens and three-headed aliens, or between people with earth-themed elemental powers and people with water-themed elemental powers, or whatever.\nNote that this can also cover other types of prejudice: anti-homosexual sentiment, religious differences, and so on. note\xa0In which case, "Fantastic Discrimination" or "Fantastic Prejudice" would be a more apt term.\nNot to be confused with Space Jews, in which an imaginary species or culture has disturbing similarities to a real-world racist stereotype. Also related to Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?, when monsters are used as a metaphor for alternative sexual identity, rather than race. Fantastic Slurs are often involved, as are Monster Rights Movements. Real Life weaselly lines like Some of My Best Friends Are X may feature. The undesired minorities may be rounded up inside a Fantastic Ghetto, they may also be the targets of Super Human Trafficking.\nFuturistic science fiction examples of human-on-alien Fantastic Racism will often make the human racist a member of a group historically discriminated against on Earth (such as a black character in an American-created work) both to emphasize that human-on-human racism is a thing of the past, and for the sake of irony from the viewers\' perspective.\nIf the point of the story is to show the evils of racism, this trope can lead to a Broken Aesop if there are in fact good in-universe reasons to discriminate against a certain type of creature (say, because they need to eat other sentient beings in order to survive, or they genuinely are Always Chaotic Evil apart from the odd angsty heroic one).\nAlso note that Tropes Are Not Bad: most people wouldn\'t believe in a world where elves, dwarves, aliens, etc got along with perfect harmony, because their own experiences of different groups\' interactions don\'t bear that out. It\'s called Fantastic Racism for a reason.\nIf the racism appears to be spilling into something a little less fantastic and into something more real, it\'s Values Dissonance.\nCompare Superior Species, in which one species actually is objectively superior in some way, Species Loyalty which may but does not need to entail this, and Master Race, when it\'s just in their head.\nSee also People of Hair Color, which can be another occasion for racism in fantasy, and Dehumanization, where one race is dehumanized to make them easier to kill.\nExamples that are depicted often enough to have their own subtrope are:\n Elves vs. Dwarves\n Fur Against Fang: Werewolves (or other animal shifters) versus vampires\n Just a Machine: Humans versus artificial intelligences\n Robots Enslaving Robots: Robots versus other types of robots\u2014this one is most likely to be entirely satirical\n Unequal Rites: Witches versus wizards, although this is often depicted more as Fantastic Sexism\n What Measure Is a Non-Human?: Humans versus all other sentient beings\n What Measure Is a Non-Super?: People with powers versus Muggles\n\n\nExamples\n Advertising\n Anime and Manga\n Comic Books\n Fan Fics\n Film\n Literature\n Live-Action TV\n Music\n Newspaper Comics\n Religion and Mythology\n Stand-Up Comedy\n Tabletop Games\n Video Games\n Web Comics\n Web Original\n Western Animation\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Roleplay\xa0\n Pretty much the basis of This Is War, where the supernaturals were forced out of their home countries by the government doing this, only to find similar from the people in Britain.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/8511241_5354.jpg', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [], u'title': u'Fantastic Racism - TV Tropes'}, u'_index': u'tropes_and_media'}, {u'_score': 0.012630035, u'_type': u'item', u'_id': u'21051', u'_source': {u'text': u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s so much easier to see the world in black and white. Grey? I don\'t know what to do with grey..."\n\u2014 Garrus Vakarian after realizing what he was becoming, Mass Effect 2\nIn Real Life, seeing the world in absolute Black and White Morality is considered normal for small children, but seen as a far less healthy trait in adults. A person who regards the people around him as entirely good or entirely evil has this. This type of thinking is called "splitting" in psychology, and it is a symptom of Borderline Personality Disorder, a real life mental disorder also characterized by emotional instability, impulsivity, and a propensity to self-harm.\nSome authors have picked up on this, playing belief in Black and White Morality as a sign of the character being insane or at least mentally unstable.\nWhile this is almost always done in settings that are not of Black and White Morality themselves, exceptions exist. In such cases, a Lawful Good Anti-Hero suffering from Black and White Insanity can be very disturbing indeed in the eyes of their fellow Lawful Good real heroes.\nThis trope is not about regarding everyone as either completely sane or completely insane.\nA Character suffering from Black and White Insanity is likely to reason in False Dichotomies and keep their worldview coherent by applying huge quantities of Insane Troll Logic and meeting criticism with Abomination Accusation Attacks. Black and White Insanity might also be what makes a Well-Intentioned Extremist, well, an extremist. This kind of insanity is pretty much the characteristic of the Obliviously Evil Knight Templar. Character development might lead to the insane one becoming a Troubled Sympathetic Bigot. A justice system that operates on Black and White Insanity believes that All Crimes Are Equal.\nCompare Activist Fundamentalist Antics, Wrong Genre Savvy, Windmill Crusader, With Us or Against Us, Moral Myopia.\nContrast Black and White Morality (for settings where the world actually operates in a way that makes this kind of world-view completely rational). A failed attempt at Black and White Morality will make the main character come across as suffering from Black and White Insanity.\nNote: This trope is about characters who have a black and white worldview AND are mentally unstable.\n\n\nExamples\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime and Manga\xa0\n Eren Yeager, the protagonist of Attack on Titan. Considering the complex and morally grey world he lives in, it more often than not causes him problems. As a child, he brutally killed a pair of murderers and justified it by stating they were merely "animals that looked like humans". As a teenager, he reacts to Tragic Villains expressing remorse by exploding into a rage and stating they are inhuman monsters not allowed to feel emotions. When confronted by situations that are morally complicated, he tends to either freeze up or get angry. It makes his attempts to understand Annie\'s reasons for killing people all the more shocking. For whatever reason, he cannot simply dehumanize Annie like he does to other villains.\n In Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou, Earth-chan subscribes to extreme black and white morality. She views any improper behavior, even anything as innocuous as a white lie, as absolutely Evil; and she cannot even understand why anyone would willingly lie. Likewise, she cannot understand someone trying but failing to live up to a moral ideal \u2014 any failure to measure up is in her eyes a willful embrace of Evil. This attitude is shown to be at odds with a world filled with shades of grey, and results in Earth-chan coming to hasty conclusions about who is in the right and taking actions which solve the immediate situation but don\'t actually address the underlying problem \u2014 for instance, trying to address the problem of pollution by destroying a factory\'s smokestacks and then flying away with the satisfaction of a job well done, not comprehending that the factory will simply fix the smokestacks and continue as usual.\n This tends to come up in Death Note a lot. Light Yagami starts to shift into this as the series goes on. He sees himself and all the actions he takes as good, including killing hundreds of people. He also sees anyone who criticizes him as wrong, killing a man on live television for condemning him. The fourth Kira is this through and through (he essentially had this as a child, but couldn\'t quite grow out of it).\n Martian Successor Nadesico has this in the form of the Jovians. An Aesop for you, children: don\'t mould the society of your Lost Colony around an old-school Anime series that espouses Black and White Morality, especially to the point that said colony forgets how reality is.\n When first encountered in Mega Man Megamix, Duo seems to have this problem. He arrives specifically to kill Dr. Wily and all his robots, but runs into Mega Man, who adheres to Thou Shall Not Kill and would rather bring Wily to the courts. Duo takes this to mean that Mega Man has turned evil, with his Robot Master brothers from the first game considered as still tainted by their prior programming, and attempts to kill them to get to Wily.\n\n Shinn Asuka\'s greatest problem is Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny is his inability to see or accept shades of grey. He\'s not exactly insane, but he\'s certainly highly unstable. By the finale though, he has definitely gone off the deep end, being willing to defend a Kill Sat about to destroy an entire country because he believes that country to be pure evil (the fact that he was until recently a native citizen of said country actually fuels this belief).\n Shinn\'s mess of anger issues are the root cause of this way of thinking; or rather lack of thinking. He\'s not a bad kid, really, just too Hot-Blooded for his own good.\n One Piece has the concept of "absolute justice," where law enforcers have a very strict black-and-white view of justice to the point where any deviation from the law in favor of piracy, is met with swift, harsh punishment. Fleet-Admiral Sakazuki of the Marines, who will execute people who so much as know certain criminals. A ship full of refugees met a fiery end due to the fact that a criminal might have gotten aboard (treating criminal tendency there as though it were Mad Cow Disease, if you will). Granted, these are all based on well-known global laws.\n Even worse is Robb Lucci with his "Dark Justice" which goes further in that things against the government don\'t need to be destroyed for the greater good, but because they are evil by nature of being against the government. He doesn\'t just think the soldiers he killed for being so weak as to get taken hostage was inexcusable or killing Robin is necessary to maintain world order, he thinks the soldiers\' weakness and Robin\'s existence are unforgivable sins.\n\n Sensui from YuYu Hakusho. Emphasis on "insanity." "Humans are good - Demons are bad." Sensui existed and killed by this creed. When confronted face-to-face with atrocities committed by humans upon demons instead of the other way around, he snapped so hard he formed six additional personalities just to deal with the trauma.\n In Zetman, the Amagi corporation\'s heir Kouga idolizes Alphas, a Super Hero who fights For Great Justice, and tries to emulate him even into adulthood by having some of his father\'s scientists make him a power-enhancing superhero costume. For a while he manages to do more good than harm because he is not mentally unstable, just idealistic and naive. However, everything goes wrong when Hayami injects him with a bug from a clone of Ichirou that turns him into a delusional Knight Templar while he\'s under control.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comic Books\xa0\n In Batman Two-Face is sometimes portrayed as having this as the root of his multiple personality disorder.\n This is particularly obvious in his post-Year One characterisations, where the "good" persona believes in fairness and the hope of goodness in people, while the "evil" side sees unfairness and cheating everywhere. To quote his revised origin:\n"Harvey": Good boys don\'t do bad things.\n"Two-Face": BAD BOYS DON\'T DO GOOD THINGS.\n His original character concept was even more so. Originally he was actually supposed to do good deeds when the coin landed unscarred face up.\n Batman himself occasionally comes into this Depending on the Writer, usually in stories in which it\'s pointed out how close to insanity he often walks. The Joker in particular seems very fond of calling him out on this, most famously in The Killing Joke.\n An early version of the Heterodyne Boys (the basis of the characters of the same name in Girl Genius, but specifically not the same guys, according to Studio Foglio) has the characters traveling to an alternate universe with Grey and Grey Morality (Grimjack #40), where they end up killing the first guy they meet in a bar. They then proceed to conclude that he must have been evil, because where they come from, only evil people ever die. In their own universe, that is assumed to be true, but in the universe they ended up in, that combined with their abilities essentially makes them a pair of Omnicidal Maniacs.\n In Logicomix, Ferge is totally honest and devoted to truth & logic. Sadly, this devotion combined with Ignorant of Their Own Ignorance leads to Black and White Insanity in the form of a Straw Vulcan despite for women and Jews. On the whole, this makes him a Troubled Sympathetic Bigot who is desperately trying to do the right thing.\n Rorschach in Watchmen, meant deliberately as a comment on Steve Ditko\'s more fanatically Objectivist characters. This is clearly reflected in his Expressive Mask, where the black and white never mix.  This also led to his death, as he refused to compromise and decided to tell the world the truth despite knowing it would only make all the deaths from the plan meaningless and will put the world on the brink of nuclear annihilation. Which is why Dr. Manhattan killed him to prevent him from doing so.\n Rorschach: Never compromise! Not even in the face of Armageddon.\n Detective Gould in Red Handed sees all crime, regardless of the justification, as an intolerable evil. Many of the criminals in his city of Red Wheel Barrow are more sad than sinister, and in a conversation broken up among chapters of the graphic novel, another character tries to break the certainty of his worldview.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fanfic\xa0\n Discussed in Total Drama Nations. Dmitri tells Emma that she\'s applying this to all of the other contestants and that it is unhealthy to think that way. Emma, thinking that she is just being a hero, doesn\'t know how to react. The Insanity part of it comes later, once she starts hallucinating voices and attempts murder on three of her more villainous teammates.\nEmma: No. Dmitri\'s wrong. Sure, there may be a few neutral people in the world. But, especially in Total Drama, everyone can be split into good or evil.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Film\xa0\n Two-Face\'s condition is even worse in Batman Forever, where his good side, if he even has one, seems to be an excuse at best. To emphasize the point, he has two female henchmen named Sugar and Spice, a pair of attractive women who are supposed to represent his good side (Drew Barrymore) and his evil side (Debi Mazar) in very sexy ways. However, Sugar, the one who is supposed to represent his good side, is just as evil as Spice.\n Two-Face\'s actions show that rather than having a good side and an evil side, he only has the evil side but becomes obsessed with wanting the world to be fair. He only looks to commit murders but everyone gets a coin toss for a chance to be let go.\n In Detective Story, Detective Jim McLeod views the world this way, even refusing to give a break to a man who embezzled a small amount of money despite the victim not wanting to prosecute. He tells them that he\'ll commit another crime and another until he\'s like the gibbering idiots they\'ve also arrested. His world collapses when he finds out his saintly wife knew men before him, became pregnant and had an abortion.\n God Bless America: With his strict morality of right versus wrong, Frank Murdoch\'s reality crumbles. He comes across as being less capable of comprehending the world than Roxy Harmon, who easily exploit his insecurity to get him to embark on his misguided crusade. While he\'s a Windmill Crusader, she seems to simply be in it For the Evulz.\n The television ranter, tea party members and Westboro Baptist Church picketers Frank kills are also portrayed as suffering from this - either genuinely or simply pretending to get attention.\n In The Ledge, Joe lives in his own personal world of strictly black and white morality. This gives a life that is very good but also very fragile. When reality doesn\'t conform to his over-simplified world-view, everything crumbles.\n Overzealous mall cop Ronnie Barnhardt in Observe and Report suffers from this flaw, in addition to Bipolar Disorder.\n In Silent Hill, Christabella and her cultists see the world in black-and-white, refusing to understand how horrible their own deeds are or that the hellish state of the world they live in is their own fault.\n Star Wars: In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker slowly becomes more and more deluded that all opponents of Chancellor Palpatine are enemies of the Republic, culminating in him declaring a With Us or Against Us to his former mentor.\n In Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil, Chad keeps insisting in a black and white narrative with himself as the good guy and the hillbillies as the villains. Since said hillbillies are the eponymous characters, well...\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n\n Played with in the Discworld books. Granny Weatherwax is accused of having an overly black-and-white view of the world in Carpe Jugulum, but as she explains to Mightily Oats, in her opinion "gray\'s just white that\'s got grubby."\n In Flatland, the ruling caste enforce a Black and White Morality worldview to the point where they outlaw color, enforcing the world to literally be black and white. Their excuse for this draconic law is that it\'s needed for preserving the sexual purity of their women.\n Javert from Les Mis\xe9rables has no room in his worldview for moral ambiguity. No matter how minor your crime was, if you break the law at all, you are evil in his eyes. He chases down Jean Valjean for twenty-one years because Valjean broke his parole. Javert\'s case of Black and White Insanity is so strong that when events force him to confront his worldview and his worldview creates a moral dilemma he can\'t solve, he is overtaken by despair and throws himself off a bridge into the Seine.\n In A Song of Ice and Fire:\n The priestess/sorceress Melisandre of Asshai is convinced that everything she does, including burning people alive or using magic to fake the appearance of a prophecy coming true, is all in the name of the greater good. This is probably best exemplified when she speaks to Davos Seaworth. She asks if he is a good man or an evil one, he says that like most men he has both. Her response:\nIf half an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.\n Davos reflects the metaphor right back at her: when he delivered his ship of much-needed supplies to the besieged soldiers of Storm\'s End, many of the onions were half-rotten, and eagerly eaten nonetheless.\n Daenerys Targaryen has a fair bit of difficulty understanding that not all of the people who rebelled against her father and usurped her family\'s throne are faithless, power hungry traitors. In particular, every time she hears anyone say anything good about Eddard Stark (who the readers know one of the only genuinely heroic characters in the series) she refuses to listen, and continues believing him to be a cold hearted villain. She starts to grow out of this after finding out from Barristan Selmy that her father really was The Caligula. She\'s also not as quick to condemn Eddard for his association with Robert Baratheon when she realizes that by the same logic that she uses to condemn him, (essentially guilt by association) she is a childkiller like her dragon.\n Try telling Cersei Lannister that fawning sycophants do not great allies make. Or that criticism aimed in her direction does not automatically make somebody a deadly enemy to put on the "accident" list. Well, she doesn\'t always do that: she also verbally abuses and belittles them enough to actually making them loathe her enough to become active roadblocks. If you are not her child, her twin or a Yes-Man, she just doesn\'t see why she can\'t abuse and discard you, as you\'re never going to be worthy to be truly on her side.\n Galad from The Wheel of Time has a comparatively minor case of this; he\'s described as "always doing the right thing, no matter who it hurts" and has very strict ideas concerning what right and wrong entail. This leads him eventually to join the Children of the Light, an organization (in)famous for this kind of thinking. In the later books he begins to be lighten up, at least a little, especially after people he respects challenge his world view and point out how even the best intentioned person can be simply wrong, even working from the best information that they have. On the plus side, because he\'s now influential in the Children, his lightening up is taking the organization with him.\n As a whole, the Children of the Light. Quite a few of them smell rabid to wolves.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live Action TV\xa0\n Buffyverse:\n The Watchers Council says all demons are evil. Of course, this is first disproved by the vampire with a soul Angel, and then the soulless vampire Spike, who actually goes and gets a soul for love. Not to mention Clem, a demon so non-evil that not only does Buffy trust him with Dawn, but Dawn is able to push him around (and he comes to Buffy\'s birthday party). Not to mention that the Slayers themselves have powers that are demonic in origin.\n Angel showed the Council\'s position to be nonsense, with scores of non-evil demons appearing. Even many of the demons they fight are "evil" not in a Legions of Hell apocalyptic way, but in a career criminal, thug-for-hire way.\n Connor. The sad fact is that he never really adjusts to our world. Angel is a killer; therefore, he should die. The world is harsh and cruel; Jasmine made it a paradise, so she must be good.\n He considers himself above Angel Investigations in this respect, accusing them of fighting empty battles and helping to maintain the status quo.\n Satoru Tojo from Kamen Rider Ryuki is a Heroic Wannabe with a habit of killing off his close acquaintances and dismissing the other Riders in the Rider War as unworthy of being \'heroes\'. Notably, it\'s his presence and conviction that what he is doing is right that causes protagonist Shinji Kido to seriously take into consideration that the participants of the Rider War are not simply made up of bad people wanting to do bad things, and that there are a lot of gray areas to be considered.\n Monk will try prosecuting people for letting their dogs pee in the street, having an uneven number of buttons undone on their shirts/sweaters or wearing mismatched socks, because such "crimes against the universe" will "invariably" lead to crimes like Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking. And don\'t even get him started on nudists....\n Virginia in the North and South (Trilogy) miniseries is against slavery. Fine. Believing that everyone from the southern USA is Always Chaotic Evil? Not so fine. And it keeps going downhill from there, with her ruining her own life and arguably becoming more of a liability to her cause rather then an asset.\n Police commander Howard "Bunny" Colvin from The Wire bemoans how police adopting a black and white mentality and an increasing determination to never compromise or question the "War on Drugs", regardless of its obvious failings, has changed being a police officer for the worse throughout his career. In one frustrated speech, he says that police officers are being turned into wartime soldiers, and outlines what he sees as the differences between the two. (According to him, one protects a community and the people within it, while the other kills their enemies.) He goes on to add this has only succeeded in turning the very community police are supposed to protect into their enemies.\nI mean you call something a war, and pretty soon everyone is going to be running around acting like warriors. They gonna be running around on a damn crusade, storming corners, racking up body counts. And when you at war, you need a fucking enemy. And pretty soon damn near everybody on every corner is your fucking enemy. And pretty soon the neighborhood you\'re supposed to be policing, that\'s just occupied territory.... Soldiering and policing, they ain\'t the same thing.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n In Bad Religion lyrics, this trope is implied to be one of the main problems with people and society.\n In Billy Joel\'s song "Shades of Grey", while he notes his own departure from Black and White Morality and how much easier it was, he also cautions in the vein of this trope:\n And the only people I fear\n are those who never have doubts\n Save us all from arrogant men,\n and all the causes they\'re for\n This is also exemplified in the title character of his "Angry Young Man."\n The video for the Insane Clown Posse song "Chris Benoit" touches on this in the form of a rubix cube that arranges itself from evenly checkered to solid black or white on each side, representing the titular wrestler\'s descent into the insanity that led him to kill his family. The use of chess pieces and dice also add to the Black versus White theme prevalent in the video.\n The Monkees also did a song "Shades of Grey" with the same theme, but without the caution aspect.\n A Vocaloid music video called "Super Hero" has the title character Kagamine Len choose to become a super hero like his idol on a cartoon show in order to administer justice. Over time, he finds the real evil lies in the government and tries to destroy the system for the greater good.\n I\'m a super hero!! The time has come to change the world Call me insane? Call me a murderer? You\'re the ones who are evil!\n Terrorist, you say? That\'s outrageous! Hey, where do you think you\'re taking me?! I protect everyone, this town, this world, and you! I\'m your great and noble hero!! This wasn\'t the way it ended on TV...\n In another Vocaloid song, "Karakuri Burst," Kagamine Len states that his views of morality are separated only by \'black and white\'.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Other\xa0\n Tuyet from BIONICLE. She\'s a Lawful Evil character, who wants to take over the Matoran universe because she genuinely believes she could make it a better place. However, an Alternate Universe shows that this would mean brainwashing all the other Toa into Knight Templars, and killing anyone who poses a potential threat to her position as Empress.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Tabletop Games\xa0\n Heroes in Beast: The Primordial represent the dangerous end-result of mixing this trope with Axe Crazy; they are defined as Knights Templar who will seek out and destroy all Beasts, even those who choose pretty innocuous methods of sating their Horror Hunger. In fact, Heroes see the universe in terms of "me as good; Beast as evil" that they easily slide into delusions of Protagonist-Centered Morality, allowing them to effortlessly justify anything they do to themselves as being For The Greater Good.\n The Oracles from Genius: The Transgression have this as their defining character flaw.\n In Magic: The Gathering, this is White\'s main flaw, which is why Knight Templars are fairly easy to create. A specific example were the Loxodons from Mirrodin (metal covered anthropomorphic elephants), which were mentally incapable of accepting the concept of moral shades of grey. The white phyrexians that took over Mirrodin were even worse in that regard.\n Planescape went in for the "Lawful Stupid Knight Templar" presentation of Lawful groups a bit much, at least those that weren\'t overtly Lawful Evil. The Harmonium and Mercykiller factions were especially bad, presented as draconian monsters - the courts often had to throw out cases where someone was arrested by the Harmonium for minor infractions like membership in a "wrong" faction. This came from being in a setting where belief is power and strong belief is more power, leading factions to resort to dogmatic extremism to get and keep their power.\n In an interesting subversion, it also suggested that for creatures who are born from and composed of the pure force of Good (or Law, or whatever), that to cease to see the world in the black-and-white terms of their alignment was a sign of mental instability. The main example being a group of celestials (beings of pure Good) who conspired to keep the fiends (demons and devils) wrapped up in their Enemy Civil War by running arms to both sides. Some seemed to be close to losing their grip from seeing things in shades of gray. In other words, shades-of-gray is a healthy and mature view for mortals but unhealthy for immortals, and black-and-white absolutism is the reverse.\n In Warhammer 40,000, pretty much every single sentient being is afflicted by this, due to Fantastic Racism. Except the Always Chaotic Evil ones. Of course, this being Warhammer 40000, the only mistake most of them make is assuming there\'s a \'white\'.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n In Dragon Age II, as Anders becomes more and more obsessed with the Mage/Templar issue of Kirkwall and as he\'s starting to lose the battle against Vengeance, he becomes more and more hostile to those he perceives as pro-Templar or just generally an enemy of the mages, including those in Hawke\'s party, and including other mages. At the nadir of his madness, one isn\'t even allowed to abstain from the debate; choose a side or he\'ll choose it for you and designate you an enemy.\n Fenris, too, in the other direction, to a slightly lesser extent. Fenris believes that all mages are evil, period. Interestingly, he\'s actually aware that it\'s generally a bad idea to overgeneralize the innocent many based on the actions of a guilty few. But reminding him of that will cause him to rationalize that bad magic is so tempting that all innocent mages, with the possible exception of Mage!Hawke, will eventually become guilty. The "lesser extent" part comes in because Fenris never quite acts on his belief that all mages are the same beyond insulting the mages in the party, and Fenris will sometimes apologize for being rude if it\'s pointed out to him, where Anders...well, play the end of the game for details.\n Hell, Fenris will even help mages when you point out their treatment in the game could be considered a form of slavery; the one thing Fenris hates more than mages.\n N and Team Plasma from Pok\xe9mon Black And White has this. If you\'re not in support of their insane Cartoonish Supervillainy, then you\'re a cruel and abusive Lillipup-kicking Pok\xe9mon trainer! It turns out that Team Plasma\'s claim to having this is merely a cover-up for their true motives \u2014 to Take Over the World. N turns to be the true Plasma King. The only one who wants to Take Over the World is Ghetsis. N even all but invokes the idea by name:\n "Many different values mix together, and the world becomes gray... That is unforgivable! I will separate Pok\xe9mon and people, and black and white will be clearly distinct!"\n In the sequel, Ghetsis and co are still trying to take over the world, while N is still interested in freeing Pok\xe9mon, but more specifically freeing them from Pok\xe9 Balls. As the end nears, he begins to question if people and Pok\xe9mon really can live alongside each other.\n In Super Dangan Ronpa 2 you have Nagito Komaeda, the Ultimate Lucky Student. He believes hope is good and despair is bad, therefore, all actions done in the sake of hope are good. The problem is his twisted perception of hope that leads him to  create an opportuinity to a murder on Chapter 1 and masterminding his own death in Chapter 5 on a Thanatos Gambit to kill everybody on the island.\n Heavily implied with the apparent Big Good Rohoph in the MARDEK series, due to the Violet Crystal\'s influence. Qualna calls him out on it and gets a Fate Worse Than Death for his trouble.\n Zealot Angels in Nexus games fall into this trope with frightening regularity, although it\'s hard to tell whether Namm (their patron god)is immune to it as his PR says or the worst example.\n Megami Tensei: By the end any games in the main series, both the Chaos and Law factions will have degenerated into this. Don\'t much care for a World of Silence? Then get thine ass hence, for thou art a  greedy, war-mongering Jerkass that placeth his own whims before the needs of thy fellow man\'s! Think that a world of social darwinism where Might Makes Right isn\'t your thing? Then FUCK YOU, you goody-good, backstabbing peace-lover!\n Ishida Mitsunari in Sengoku Basara. He defines \'good\' as his master, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. If you are a fellow servant of Hideyoshi, he will (grudgingly) tolerate you. If not, you are a vile sinner who will be beaten until you become a servant of Hideyoshi at best or killed in the most gruesome fashion imaginable for the \'sin\' of disobedience. It doesn\'t help that he\'s quite a Horrible Judge of Character.\n Handsome Jack of Borderlands 2 operates off of the reasoning of "Hyperion = good, everyone else = bad", completely disregarding everything good his enemies have done and his own moral bankruptcy.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n In Captain SNES: The Game Masta, Max Force labels people who disagree with him about just about anything as "druggies" and attempts to shoot them down. Once he is convinced someone is a druggie, no force in the world can convince him otherwise. And when he fails to shoot his target, he comes up with insane excuses as to why he didn\'t actually miss; he was just aiming at something else.\n Goblins: Kore the Paladin is nominally Lawful Good, a requirement maintaining his paladin status. However, he believes certain races of monsters are inherently evil, and that anyone who comes into contact with an evil creature becomes "infected" with evil themselves, which can only be cured by death. This includes people who merely come into contact with evil creatures, people who are kidnapped by evil creatures, and even people who might potentially sympathize with evil creatures. And no, children are not exempt. And the scariest part? Kore still retains his paladin magics, which means that either the divines who guide the church agree with and/or tolerate his philosophy, or there is something very WRONG with heaven. It\'s also possible it\'s a "I believe I\'m right therefore I have power" type deal. Given however that it\'s explicit in the comic that evil is triumphing in a multiversal sense, it\'s more likely to be a problem with his god.\n Miko in The Order of the Stick is built on this trope, growing increasingly delusional over the course of the story arc. As her insanity increases, it changes her from a mere Knight Templar into a total Windmill Crusader - handwaving even the fact that the Gods have stripped her of her paladin powers.\n Irina Tepes from RasputinCatamite hacks up people in the name of God, and is absolutely convinced that her activities are virtuous.\n The partisan climate of the US devolving into this on both sides was the driving force behind the less-than-stellar state of affairs in Remus\n Glinda comes off as this in the Kings War arc of Roommates, when she goes to war against an evil, greedy, glory seeking villain who fooled people into thinking that he changed and got his hand on a magical kingdom, but villains are villains and heroes heroes, period... In her own world she might be justified, OZ is not the land of great moral ambiguity, but because the comic is a Morality Kitchen Sink that villain happened to be a Lawful Good ex-Hero Antagonist, who is also the Token Good Teammate of the main cast. When she explained her reason boiled down to: "There are heroes and there are villains, you are a villain so you must be opposed."\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n Worm: Panacea aggressively categorises capes as heroes and villains with no grey area, to the point that she continues to view Skitter as an irredeemable villain even after the other breaks her back protecting a civilian shelter from Leviathan. Furthermore, in the Slaughterhouse Nine arc, she actively sabotages the Undersiders even though they\'re the main force opposing the SH 9 and save her life multiple times, just because they\'re "villains".\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Near the end of Avatar: The Last Airbender, especially in the finale, Azula begins to adopt this mindset, seeing everyone as being either completely for her or a complete traitor to her. Most notably, the end of the two-part episode "The Boiling Rock" after Mai and Ty Lee turn on her.\n Parodied when she banishes one of her twin handmaidens, convinced one is loyal and the other is treacherous, despite the fact that she can\'t tell them apart.\n Danny Phantom\'s first episode has Sam and Tucker on the opposing sides of a Meat vs. Veggies, and put Danny in the middle:\nTucker: you\'re either with me...\nSam: ...or you\'re against him!\nBoth: SO WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?!\n Gravity Falls has Rumble McSkirmish. A character from a fighting game played by Dipper, he comes to the conclusion that Robbie, Dipper\'s romantic rival, is evil and killed Dipper\'s father. When Dipper admits he lied, Rumble decides that Dipper is a villain as well and beats him too.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link':

dress like a queen Best way a girl can dress for me Is in a goblin suit (they look so cute...)"\n\u2014 Frank Zappa, "Goblin Girl"\nAny "exotic" being (alien, monster, robot, demon, ghost, etc.) bearing a strong resemblance to a conventionally attractive human female, sometimes when there is no reason for her to appear that way.\nThis trope comes in several varieties:\nThe result of a common form of Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism in fiction, in which the female members of a nonhuman species are much more attractive/less monstrous (read: more human looking) than the males;\nA "cute" female version of a previously-existing, not originally attractive monster, such as a Gorgeous Gorgon;\n A Half-Human Hybrid of a monster that happens to be female, and cute;\nAnomalous among her people, despised or considered a freak, but a knockout by human conventions of beauty.\nA function of Men Are Generic, Women Are Special, specifically the idea that male monsters can look however they want, but female monsters need things to differentiate them from the male monsters and make them recognizably female to the audience. When the Male Gaze gets involved this results in common design features for female characters in other contexts, like Hartman Hips, Non-Mammal Mammaries, long hair, and Tertiary Sexual Characteristics like dresses or make-up (or bits of anatomy designed to look like a dress or make-up), even if it would make no sense for such a creature to have these features. While this is often done for purposes of Fanservice it can also be for What Measure Is a Non-Human? reasons, as the audience is more likely to sympathise with a Monster Girl who looks more human than one who looks more monstrous. Conversely it can be done for Grotesque Cute reasons, contrasting the monstrous and cute side, especially if they still act like the monster they\'re based on.\nFemale One Gender Races are typically these. Very rarely, you will get a Cute Monster Guy, although this is much more common with vampires. However, younger variants more of the traditional definition of "cute" (I.e. Children) for both genders are a bit more common. Assume that if there is a Monster Mash, the few female member(s) will be Cute Monster Girls. May involve Stripperiffic designs.\nSubtrope of Monstrous Humanoid. Related to Moe Anthropomorphism and Gijinka in Fan-Art circles. Often subject to Fantastic Arousal. Compare Cute Alien Girl, Cute Eldritch Abomination Girl, Cute Humanoid Animal Girl, Cute Ghost Girl, and Slime Girl. Related to You Sexy Beast, although males are the more common recipient of that.\n\nExamples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime and Manga\xa0\n Borders on crossing over into the DANGER ZONE but Bagi\u25ca of Bagi the Monster of Mighty Nature. Though as the movie progresses she begins to regress towards her half-animal side and eventually loses speech and coherent thought by the end.\n In Blue Exorcist, Rin is a Cute Monster Guy. Cute Little Fangs, Pointy Ears, fluffy tail, and all. He just also happens to be the resident Anti Anti Christ.\n The Culdcept manga has a few including elves, dryads, harpies, and a Humanoid Abomination octopus-girl.\n Almost the entire female cast of Daily Life with Monster Girl, which features a Lamia, a centaur, a harpy, a slime, a mermaid, an arachne, and those are just the main six. The series also puts much more focus on the monster aspect of the characters, as every chapter tends to explore an interesting aspect of their race beyond their superficial appearance. Suu dissolves in large bodies of water. Mia has trouble shedding her skin when she\'s stressed. Papi, like all harpies, has a small figure which helps her fly.\n Continued in the above example\'s author\'s other work, Deadline Summonner. This work has a diverse harem of ten who could easily destroy the main character with their affections\u2014or accidentally kill him in the crossfire of their fights over who gets to be the "Main" summon.\n Same author as the above two, 12 Beast ups the ante with an entire army of cute monster girls\u2014and boys! Though the majority of the focus is still on the ladies, Eita\'s army does not lack eye candy for other orientations.\n Demonbane takes this to the logical extreme: we have several examples of Grimoires that take the form of young teenaged girls, rather than books. Apparently this is because these particular Grimoires have so much magic power in them that they have developed a soul, and take a form more appropriate for an ensouled being. Why all of them are female is not addressed, although in the sequel we meet a male half-human, half-grimoire (yes, really).\n Chomesuke from D.Gray-Man has 2 forms, the mostly human (if occasionally black-eyed) form, and her completely demonic form, which is also kind of cute, in a Kingdom Hearts sort of way.\n Digimon:\n The Wind warriors from Digimon Frontier - when Zoe obtains the Beast Wind spirit, not only does it resemble nothing other than a lingerie model with avian wings and feet, but unlike every other (good) Beast spirit, it doesn\'t even have the destructive impulses that took other characters up to three episodes to get under control. This is slightly more excusable with the other Wind warriors, as one of them is supposed to be human, another is supposed to be half-human, and the last has no real requirements - but each form distinctly fails in the "Monster" part of "Digital Monster".\n Angewomon, LadyDevimon, Lilymon and Rosemon from Digimon Adventure. The Bishoujo Line means most female Digimon are gonna end up like this at some point.\n If you want to keep the \x91monster\x92 in monster girl, you want the villainous Ranamon. Green, covered with seashell-themed, uh, head-things, and cute as a button. Her Beast Spirit form, Calmaramon, is much more monstrous, with a giant squidlike body beneath the humanoid portion. Though it wasn\'t used that way, you get the feeling the designer had in mind hapless victims approaching a "woman" in the water, and then out comes Cthulhu\'s little sister to kill you to death.\n Chocola, the vampire daughter of Don Dracula. One episode has Don Dracula specify that her mother was the most beautiful woman he has ever known, and that Chocola takes after her.\n Mink from Dragon Half, though granted, she\'s half human herself; her mother is a dragon. Her mother is usually transformed into a humanoid form but tends to break it when she becomes angry especially if the object of her rage is her philandering, lecherous, human husband.\n Celty from Durarara!! is a Dullahan that looks like a beautiful, though deathly pale, woman from the neck down. From the neck up? Well, she has no head. When we do finally see her head, it\'s that of a cute, auburn-haired girl \u2014 A far cry from the hideous, rotten-fleshed heads of the Dullahan of Celtic legend.\n Elfen Lied: Diclonii\'s horns resemble cute cat ears.\n The Bugrom of El-Hazard: The Magnificent World mostly resembled giant neon cockroaches, with the exception of their queen, who resembled a normal attractive human female with antennae.\n Franken Fran:\n Fran Madaraki is a Moe Frankenstein\'s Monster. Or at least her appearance is cute (when she isn\'t falling apart). Fran herself is... less than cute.\n Her similarly stitched up sisters Gavrill and Veronica can be pretty damn cute (that is, when they\'re not being fucking terrifying) as can officer Kuhou after she was transformed into a monster girl.\n Miiru from the second volume of Fushigi Yuugi. She is actually a servant of Tenkou who became such because she and her brother were killed for incest and wanted Tenkou\'s help to find a place where they could be happy. In the manga, her shadow is shown as a demon.\n Neko Musume in GeGeGe no Kitaro was originally an aversion... until one of her more recent redesigns.\n Mayu of Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun. For a succubus, she\'s cute, busty, and Does Not Like Men. She\'s training to work on the last part, though. Later, her friend and love rival Reika is revealed to be a succubus as well, albeit without the Androphobia, instead having a healthy dose of Cannot Spit It Out.\n This is the point of the Haiyore! Nyarko-san series, with bonus Did You Just Romance Cthulhu? levels. All the Eldritch Abominations appear in completely humanoid (and rather cute) forms, but the most diabetes-inducingly cute character (Hastur) is a boy.\n Seras Victoria from Hellsing is a vampire, but she looks normal except for her red eyes.\n Himemiko from Kamisama Kiss, at least when she is in her human form. Her real form is a catfish demon.\n The title character of Karin (a.k.a, "Chibi Vampire")\n Is This a Zombie?: Virtually every female introduced, except Haruna, a Magical Girl, and the two girls who are Muggles.\n Niche from Letter Bee, as while her cuteness depends on who you ask, she certainly fills the monster and girl roles. And then there\'s Niche\'s sister...\n Though the Zentradi from Macross and Robotech are Human Aliens, the males range in appearance from ugly to average to handsome, with the occasional odd skin tone and/or cybernetic aspect, while the female Zentradi are always depicted as beautiful. The Zentradi designs in Do You Remember Love? are probably the strongest examples of this trope.\n Magical Pokaan gives us four Cute Monster Girls - a werewolf, a vampire, a witch, and an android. The student council in Demon King Daimao has the exact same four characters.\n Mahou Sensei Negima! has Evangeline, half of Magicus Mundus, most prominently Fate\'s underlings, and Setsuna, a half-tengu and self-proclaimed monster (not that anybody cares). And it appears Zazie is actually a mazoku.\n Various female demons in Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. Most notable is Grand Princess Fire Dragon, who is herself an attractive rather petite woman with only token nonhuman features; her father is a ten-foot-tall barely-anthropomorphic dragon-man. Maou might technically count, though she doesn\'t appear to be anything other than completely human most of the time.\n There is a whole sub-genre for redrawing mecha as girls wearing the machine as armor. It has gone so far as the Destroid Monster! But perhaps the ultimate mecha example is the Valsion\'s\u25ca entirely canon sister unit, the Valsione\u25ca. (Apparently the Valsion\'s operator made the Valsione for his daughter, who gave it a feminine form out of personal preference.)\n Monster Soul has a few, with two of them being a mummy and a golem respectfully.\n My Balls is all about cute monster girls.\n All of the female mermaids in My Bride Is a Mermaid. The males tend to be less "cute" and more "Manly". Except Masa.\n Gainax\'s various merchandise for Neon Genesis Evangelion includes the "Apostle XX" line of figurines, which takes several of the Angels and gives them a female humanoid makeover. Behold Lilith, Sachiel, Shamshel, Sahaquiel, Zeruel, Arael, Armisael and Tabris. Technically, Rei and Kaworu might count, though the latter is a Cute Monster Boy instead.\n Yuki-Onna/Tsurara from Nurarihyon No Mago, as well as a majority of the other humanoid female youkai.\n Almost every member of the Unwanted Harem in Omamori Himari. There\'s a Cat Girl with Gag Boobs, a Foreign Fanservice Meido tea-cup spirit with even bigger Gag Boobs, a Token Mini-Moe water-snake spirit Emotionless Girl, and a blood-thirsty Yandere forest spirit.\n One Piece:\n The merpeople. The mermen (male) both have the tail of fishes and fish features on their upper bodies such as gills, spines and pointy teeth. The mermaids (female) all have the upper bodies of regular humans and are almost always dead-sexy.\n The female Fishman, Octopako could possibly be "cute"\n Well except for one prominent subversion,  Kokoro. She was sexy too in her youth, though.\n Monet from Punk Hazard is a harpy and easy on the eyes.  Until she goes into her monster form thanks to the Snow Snow Fruit\n Scanty and Kneesocks, the demon sisters from Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt.\n Petopeto San is entirely devoted to the concept of cute monster girls (some of which are half human).\n Shia, from Pita-Ten, is a demon/demon\'s apprentice (depending on whether you\'re reading the manga or watching the anime,) but she looks completely human and is also very, very, very cute. The males in canon all fawn for her and many develop actual feelings for her, as well. Although, another demon is also shown, Klaus, and he\'s also cute in a shoujo kind of way, himself.\n Princess Resurrection has Riza Wildman; granted, she\'s at least half human, but the other half (and DEFINITELY the side she takes after) is a flesh tearing, vicious werewolf. There\'s also Reiri and Flande, as well as the main character Hime who\'s a phoenix in human form, among a few others.\n Ragnarok the Animation:\n Maya make friends with an "Alice" (a high-level humanoid monster). This is the impetus for explaining her Dark and Troubled Past.\n Jiltus, being a half-human hybrid, is very cute if you like them evil.\n Every single girl except for Kyoko (Tsukune\'s cute but human cousin) in Rosario + Vampire. They spend the most of their time hiding their monster traits, though, so they look completely human except during fights, and when transformed the main gals (and many of the supporting cast) are STILL cute (Moka is devastatingly so, Kurumu becomes ultra exotic, etc.).\n Sailor Moon combined this with Progressively Prettier. The Youma and Cardians were, for the most part, fairly monstrous-looking. Droids, Daimons, Lemures and Phages were much more attractive; while there are a few monstrous ones, they were mostly beautiful women with pointed ears and/or oddly colored skin.\n Sanka Rea has the eponymous zombie girl.\n Graham from Shamanic Princess is a male version; he is a unsettling-yet-endearing patchwork of Bishounen and Gothic horror monster (like Frankenstein\'s Monster or The Phantom of the Opera).\n The eponymous character of Shinryaku! Ika Musume is an adorable squid-girl.\n A fair amount of the female cast of Sola.\n The Seedrians from the third season of Sonic X are like this. The males are monsters that transform into Godzilla-like creatures (and later become Decepticon-like robots...for reasons that aren\'t thoroughly explained...), but the females are cute plant-girls, and Tails falls in love with one named Cosmo.\n Holo from Spice and Wolf is a very cute girl\u25ca with wolf ears and a big fluffy tail, both of which she keeps hidden under clothing when she wants to pass for human. Her true form is that of a wolf as large as a bus, which is rather less cute.\n Today\'s Cerberus gives us humanoid versions of not just Cerberus but also Fenrir, Jormungand, and Orthrus.\n Seth Nightroad from Trinity Blood.\n Hazuki from Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase. Anyone unfamiliar with the story and character would NEVER assume she\'s a monster! The opening theme doesn\'t help.\n Urusei Yatsura:\n Lum looks like a cute teenaged girl with green hair and little horns, but is explained as being an alien whose race is the inspiration for Japanese ogres. Her being such is actually lifted straight from Japanese mythology, where Oni women are supernaturally beautiful, but capable of assuming fearsome visages when angry or jealous.\n Lum\'s friend Oyuki (a yuki-no-onna - although these ghosts are usually portrayed as attractive anyway) and secondary character Kurama (crow tengu - her servants look like anthropomorphic crows, while she\'s a pretty girl with small crow wings on her head). One might tentatively incorporate Ran (loosely based on the Gaki, a life-draining ghost) and Benten (a punk biker version of the Goddess of Knowledge, Art and Beauty) into this category as well.\n Merag, the only female Barian Emperor in Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL is cute in her own unique way likely because she\'s very beautiful in her human form as Rio Kamishiro.\n Tons of them in YuYu Hakusho, especially during the tournament which features a cat-girl announcer and a dragon-girl referee. There are Monster Boys too, (Yoko) Kurama probably being the main one.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comic Books\xa0\n Most of the student body in All-Ghouls School.\n Komodo from Avengers: The Initiative got her powers by stealing Curt Connors\' Lizard formula. But whereas the Lizard is a hulking, almost crocodilian monster with thick scales and an elongated reptilian head, Komodo just looks like an otherwise attractive girl who happens to have smooth green skin, pointy ears, Non-Mammal Mammaries, reptilian eyes, claws, and a tail.\n Freaks\' Squeele has Chance, a nice spontaneous and somehow clumsy college girl ...Oh, and she has horns and bat wings.\n Gold Digger goes both ways; cute monster girls along with cute monster guys.\n Gali, or Galacta, daughter of Galactus. She appears to be an attractive human woman.\n Delphyne Gorgon is a Cute Gorgon from The Incredible Hercules. She even wears a skimpy Goth-styled schoolgirl uniform.\n While the regular Incredible Hulk is generally seen as a berserk, hideously muscular, unintelligent monster when in Hulk form, She-Hulk is just a somewhat larger, stronger, greener version of her human counterpart. Originally, the explanation was that an individual mutated by gamma rays subconsciously determines their transformed appearance; the Hulk transforms into a hulking angry brute because of Bruce Banner\'s repressed anger, the Abomination transforms into a hideous freak due to his inner self-loathing, and She-Hulk transforms into an Amazonian Beauty because of her subconscious desire to look like the ideal woman.\n Invincible has a heroine who transforms into a monstrous form. While the monster transformation isn\'t exactly cute, the actual girl who is really older than she appears is.\n Fantasia Faust, from the erotic fantasy comic Ironwood, started out as a very bulky non-gendered iron golem designed to kill fae. Then her creator figured that the golem would be more effective if he made it really attractive and disguised the fact that it was made of iron. Then, once the fae were dealt with, he realized he had a super-strong, super-sexy non-human babe hanging around, and decided to explore a few fetishes of his.\n Marvel Comics\' Skrulls would often fit, with the males being bug eyed and inhuman, while their princess was quite fetching, and bereft of the Skrull chin ripple. Later artworks shows the males as more human-looking, and the females having unusually large eyes (but there was still some gap in attractiveness). Since they\'re a whole species of shapeshifters though, they can look however they want, and as Runaways shows they can even switch genders at will.\n Lampshaded in an issue of Namor The Sub-Mariner, where all the women are akin to Green-Skinned Space Babe while all Atlantean males are blue brutes, except for Prince Namor.\n Scott Pilgrim has Matthew Patel\'s demon hipster chicks.\n The Star Wars: Legacy comics have made almost a running gag of "prettying up" females of various alien races - Darth Maladi and Kee are good examples, and contrast Nakia, a female Anzat, with a typical male example\u25ca of the same species (at least her husband wasn\'t exactly ugly either). There\'s also a quite good-looking male Twi\'lek (compared to the films, anyway) like Shado.\n Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose has many appearing throughout the series.\n Teen Titans:\n Miss Martian looks like a cute Green-Skinned Space Babe, but her true form is that of a ravenous, blood-thirsty alien monster. It was implied in one issue that if she ever lost control and reverted to her true form, she\'d be powerful enough to slaughter her teammates in a matter of minutes.\n Kid Devil, who is a lean and muscular teenage demon and goes around shirtless.\n Valhalla: in one story, the jotun Tjasse bemoans the fact that his daughter Skade is so ugly that it is impossible to find a suitor for her. On the second page of his complaints, she turns around and we see her face, revealing that she may be ugly to a jotun but fairly good-looking to a god or human. Her usual countenance is still too severe for her to be called cute, until she is (literally) swept off her feet and has a silly, cute, enamoured grin take over her face.\n Common in various X-Men comics, especially Generation X; most of the more monstrous mutations will be male, while the women are always sexy.\n Beauty Equals Goodness is often going on there. For example, when she first showed up, Marrow had bones sticking out all over, including on her face. Later, she joined the X-Men, and it wasn\'t long before she was made more attractive, with most of the protrusions gone and those that remained looking like they could merely be part of her costume (her prettification at least wasn\'t overnight for no reason other than being one of the good guys, story-wise). There are other examples, but she\'s probably the most obvious.\n The resident girl werewolf - Wolfsbane - is a bit of an inversion, having gone from having a odd/cute \'wolfweregirl\' transitional form, to a \'The Howling\'-style monstrous appearance.\n Nightcrawler, Depending on the Artist, can be a fuzzy pretty boy with Cute Little Fangs.\n Jubilee becomes this after becoming a vampire.\n Lots and lots of them in XXXenophile.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n There\'s an entire subgenre of global Fan-Art involving giving monsters from various sources the Cute Monster Girl treatment. It\'s not uncommon for them to also be shown "doing their thing", in order to bring the Grotesque Cute. The most (in)famous of these is the now-legendary Monster Girl Encyclopedia, by/from/of Japan.\n In Akatsuki Kitten Phoenix Corporation Overhaul, Diamond (and supposedly the other Agents as well) can grow non-human features, in her case devilish horns, slit red eyes, a devil\'s tail, large, dark red bat wings, Cute Little Fangs and all. Depending on how she\'s feeling, she can either make the fangs and wings enormous and eyes glowing enough to terrify a veteran demon-fighter, or she can shrink down the wings and fangs, make the eyes her normal brown, and just look adorable. Even if her arm is shoved through a man\'s chest and her face is covered in blood and a mad smile.\n The Moemon Game Mod for Pok\xe9mon FireRed and LeafGreen. Your Mons become, well, Moe Mons. And oh god, they\'re Moe.\n In the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom there are cute monster ponies. There exist the same kinds of things found in the Monster Girl Encyclopedia like slimes and mermaids (seaponies), with moth ponies and bat ponies being quite popular (the latter became canon at around the same time the fans were making it up), and some truly strange creations like tatzlponiesnote\xa0A hybrid of a pony and that massive worm thing from "Three\'s A Crowd" and (take a breath) a sentient hive-mind mass of tentacles that have infested a pony costume because they are lonely.\n The Pokemon Gijinka Project, in the same vein as Moemon.\n A "cute girl"\u25ca version of a Shriekmaw from Magic: The Gathering, complete with a legless salamander tail, neck-tentacles, and extra eyes on her chin.\n In Resonance Days, all of the Witches killed revert to a synthesis of their Human and Witch form. Sayaka is a mermaid for example.\n Travels Through Azeroth and Outland plays with this trope in the character of Daj\'yah. Daj\'yah is a troll described as being mildly attractive by human standards (she probably has the "cutefase" appearance seen on many female troll avatars in-game). Unfortunately for her, other trolls think she\'s hideous because of this.\n The Kaiju Girls of Daikaiju Academy, part of Twisted Kaiju Theater.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Animated\xa0\n Mavis Dracula in Hotel Transylvania, a vampire girl with a pixie haircut and Cute Little Fangs.\n Eva from Igor, even though she was made to look monsterous and be evil, she still has a very pretty look.\n Celia from Monsters, Inc..\n Monsters University meanwhile splits this trope down the middle: Claire Wheeler and the MU sororities, specially Python Nu Kappa and Slugma Slugma Kappa sisters, do have their "cute side". Although, like the Eta Hiss Hiss sisters being split down in the middle (although they prove to be more "monstrous" than "cute" because they WANT it that way), PNK and EEK show their scary sides as determined in the Scare Games. Dean Hardscrabble herself does not exactly have a "cute" side, but she is considered to be quite beautiful despite her terrifying appearance. Female monsters in both films prove to be mostly a mix of both, despite completely differed from humans. Then again, EVERY monster girl introduced into the films is pretty gorgeous, just look at Brynn Larson and even Sonia Lewis.\n Ginormica from Monsters vs. Aliens. Your basic white-haired girl, super-economy size.\n Sally the rag doll, from The Nightmare Before Christmas is very pretty despite being covered in stitches with blue skin with a Glasgow Grin.\n Fiona of Shrek is still fairly pretty for an ogress, despite indulging in the usual icky ogre habits.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live Action\xa0\n Angelina Jolie as Grendel\'s Mother in the 2007 film Beowulf (she has high heels... and doesn\'t wear shoes), though it\'s implied to be Shapeshifting: reflected bits of her true form are visible during her time with Grendel, and a keen observer will see her posing as a part of her treasure-hoard when Beowulf first comes to confront her, looking like a very fishy, naga sort of creature.\n The Shadow over Innsmouth-based B-Movie Dagon throws in a Deep One Cute Monster Girl by way of Our Mermaids Are Different. They still get to play the initial reveal of her monstrous, octopoidal features for horror somehow. This trope allows the movie to play a romantic angle on the original Tomato in the Mirror ending, giving it minor justification.\n The ghost in Dead Friend (aka The Ghost) was pretty cute, despite the rotting clothes and waterlogged hair/skin. At least, she was cute before she died.\n The eponymous character of Dead Girl is pretty good-looking... although probably not dating material, given everything that happens after she\'s found.\n Greta, the female gremlin from Gremlins 2: The New Batch. Technically, not a girl, since gremlins reproduce asexually, but looks and behaves like one. Resulted from gremlins playing in a genetics lab. So cute, that authors did not kill her with the rest of gremlins.\n Marla (depending on how decayed she is in a particular scene) from Hellraiser: Deader.\n A rare male example comes up in Labyrinth. All the goblins are diminutive, monstrous creatures with wart infested skin and bizarre bone structures... except for their king, Jareth, who just looks like David Bowie with make up on (and and very very tight pants).\n The females of Chaka\'s people in Land of the Lost might qualify. The males look like they did in the series (i.e. like humanoid chimps). The females are Nubile Savages.\n In Let the Right One In, Eli fits this trope, though it isn\'t clear whether she\'s a victim of her circumstances or deliberately exploiting it to get new Renfields.\n Otto from Otto; Or Up with Dead People is a rare male expample.\n A thoroughly creepy version of this trope arises in Planet of the Apes (2001). All of the characters playing apes were made to look like gorillas, chimps, etc. Helena Bonham Carter, on the other hand, looked... well, like Helena Bonham Carter in chimp make-up, eyeshadow, and lipstick. She and the other female chimps (including one played by Tim Burton\'s ladyfriend Lisa Marie) even had humanlike eyebrows, which was thoroughly bizarre to see on a chimpanzee face. Contributing to the weirdness of the situation, she spent the entire movie flirting with the male human lead, and then he kisses her at the end!\n In Species, Sil is still pretty hot in her alien form. The creature designers specifically wanted her to still be beautiful as an alien.\n Dren in Splice. The Fetish Fuel angle to her is played up to the hilt.\n Star Wars:\n While the male\u25ca Twi\'leks are fairly human like except for head-tails and bumpy foreheads, the females\u25ca are blatantly designed to look sexy. Deconstructed by having them be famous for beauty to the extent that many of them end up as enslaved dancing girls to crimelords like Jabba the Hutt.\n The difference between male and female Devaronians\u25ca is even larger. The males are horned and demon-like with sharp teeth, but the females are furred, have pointy ears and only small, vestigial horns and flat, more humanlike teeth and are generally much more attractive to members of other species than the males. Later artwork made the Devaronian females even more human, taking away their horns and fur; Darth Maladi and Kee from the Legacy comics are good examples.\n Cathar tend to have a huge gap. Male Cathar are very tall tailless anthropomorphic big cats with wide shoulders, big claws, thick necks and muzzles. Female Cathar? Small Cat Girls. It seems though that no two artists can decide just how anthropomorphic Cathar are, drawing both genders as being everything between the two extremes; in their species\'s first comics appearance Sylvar and her mate Crado were about as different as two humans, both of them Rubber-Forehead Aliens.\n The same thing usually happens to the Togorians except males are even more catlike than the Cathar (being giant, tailless bipedal cats with very little anthropomorphism).\n\n In The Howling, the werewolves are giant, long-snouted and frightening, but when Dee Wallace turns into one, it\'s cute and fluffy.\n In the fifties film The Mole People, a girl named Adad was born to a race of subterranean albinos, but has none of their features, and thus is hated and shunned by her folk. One of the archaeologists falls madly for her and promises to help her escape this hell with them. Sadly Adad is killed by a falling pillar moments after she sees the surface world for the first time.\n V/H/S: While she\'s still undeniably creepy both in her human and bat/vampire/nymphomaniac thing form, Lily (from the "Amateur Night" segment) fits this trope.\n Mystique as a little girl when Charles first meets her in X-Men: First Class.\n Penelope: Penelope herself. Though she is cursed with the "face of a pig", she really just has a pig nose and easily hidden pig ears. Though there are a few characters who run in horror, she\'s actually quite cute, something that\'s unsurprising considering she\'s basically Christina Ricci with a snout. A few characters even mention how mostly normal she looks.\n Return of the Living Dead 3: Zombie Julie still looks pretty cute even after she impales most of her body with metal spikes and glass shards to stave off the pain of undeath.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Junapur, in Cerberon, is described as quite beautiful despite her various nonhuman traits and imposing Amazon physique.\n Serendipity Sargasso, the siren secretary in the Monster Mash neo-noir City of Devils is pretty darn cute. Assuming she doesn\'t smile.\n Subverted in Codex Alera. Her Imperial Bugginess the Vord Queen tries, but mostly just manages to give everyone the creeps by combining a "green Kitai with Rapunzel Hair" look with a few too many insectile features and a frightening lack of understanding of human emotion.\n In the Discworld books female Igors, known as Igorinas, are every bit as svelte and beautiful as their male counterparts are deformed, hunchbacked, and misshapen. Handwaved by the fact that Igors of both sexes are crazy-talented at all forms of surgery, including plastic, and as Igors are devoted followers of "tradithion" it is probably that male Igors remain ugly because male assistants to Mad Scientists are supposed to be ugly, just as female assistants are meant to be beautiful. There is only one subversion in Monstrous Regiment with well, Igor.\n In The Dresden Files most of the female inhuman monsters Harry encounters are extraordinarily beautiful but equally scary, and many of them have, literally, wanted to eat him. It\'s mentioned in Skin Games that this is why he and Binder are instinctively leery about Ascher\'s advances. Ascher is Lasciel\'s new host at the time, making their caution completely justified.\n Most of the girls in Seanan McGuire\'s inCryptid novels.\n From the Seekers of Truth, Natalie Beckett aka Golem. Fairly attractive if you can ignore the stone skin. And apparently her boyfriend, Timothy Landerman aka Echidna, can. It helps that he\'s a venomous lobster-man.\n In Charles Stross\'s "Laundry" novel The Jennifer Morgue, we meet Ramona Random, a Deep One hybrid who\'s knock-out gorgeous even after she drops her glamour. It\'s mentioned in the story that Deep One hybrids generally tend to be very attractive, as this aids in achieving their design purpose of serving as effective ambassadors to the surface world.\n More Information Than You Require features a Cute Monster Girl mole-man as part of a Beethoven Was an Alien Spy gag.  She\'s this universe\'s version of Sally Hemings.\n Robert Asprin\'s Myth Adventures series includes a dimension called Trollia where the males are all hulking monsters and the females are all drop-dead sexy. The explanation: The males are Trolls, and the females are Trollops.\n Peer Gynt meets and falls in lust with a beautiful maiden who turns out to be the daughter of the troll king.\n Sandman Slim has Candy, who is probably the bubbliest and most cheerful character in the series, despite being a vampire-esque killing machine called a Jade. Aside from a few slip ups, she\'s trying to cut back.\n Used as a major plot device in the Neil Gaiman short story "Talking to Girls at Parties", where a bunch of attractive adolescent girls turn out to be odd extraterrestrial visitors.\n Asenath Waite from "The Thing On The Doorstep", part of H.P. Lovecraft\'s fiction, might qualify, sort of. She\'s a Deep One hybrid from Innsmouth described as "dark, smallish and very good looking except for over-protuberant eyes." Unlike most of her brethren, she doesn\'t seem to perpetually smell like fish. The fact that Deep One ancestry often doesn\'t show up too much until you\'re 25 to 30 if you\'re a late-bloomer probably helped her, that and the fact that her Evil Sorcerer father probably made arrangements so his current host body could interact with polite society long enough to find a more suitable one.\n In Piers Anthony\'s Xanth novels, female goblins are described as being far more attractive than male goblins. On the other hand, male harpies are handsome while the females are almost always ugly. A war was nearly started once when a female goblin and male harpy figured this out and started dating. And way far back in history, a war was started when the harpy males preferred the goblin females. Female harpies get unusually ugly when they have to mate with humans and vultures to reproduce their species, and all harpies produced by crossing harpies with humans or vultures are female, and so the cycle became vicious on several levels. It probably took Time Travel to fix that mess.\n "The Forsaken Children" has several monster girls in it, most notably Mary, the undine changeling (who\'s described as being both piscine and voluptuous).\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n Illyria from Angel. An Eldritch Abomination trapped in a human corpse, her only non-human attributes (physically, at least) are blue lines on her face and blue streaks in her hair.\n Little Ghoul on Beetleborgs was a variation of the theme, "cute" in the same was an eight-year-old little girl (although a rather precocious one) was cute. However, the reason she kept her face hidden behind her hood was because it was so incredibly terrifying that no-one could bear to look at it.\n Charmed features male and female examples. From the fifth season onwards, most demons were pretty much just human guys wearing black leather - with the odd coloured eye or markings on the face. The sisters themselves became this whenever they transformed into certain magical creatures. The Banshee from season 3 is still pretty attractive since it\'s just Alyssa Milano in a white wig, long nails and creepy eyes. Ditto for Piper when she is turned into a Fury in Season 4.\n Farscape: War Minister Ahkna is noticeably more attractive and shorter than the rest of the Scarran species; most of whom that have been seen are male (we think). She\'s still quite reptilian, but it\'s a smoother, sleeker, sexier kind of reptilian than most Scarrans we\'ve seen. The Scarran Emperor looks similar to Ahkna (though not nearly as short), and the "We\'re So Screwed" arc makes it explicit that Scarrans have different castes, and based on diet. Eating a rare flower (which grows commonly on Earth, to our hero\'s dismay once he learns how important it is) makes Scarrans more intelligent, and coincidentally look more human.\n In Grimm, the various Wesen races all have an alternative form, called a woge. Some, like Rosalie (a Fuchsbau, or fox girl), fit this trope. Others, like the Hexenbiest, don\'t.\n In Lexx, Zev Bellringer, part cluster lizard, part love slave.\n Marilyn Munster in The Munsters. Unlike the other members of the family, she looks like a normal - and beautiful - human girl (although the other members of the family see her as ugly). She shares some of the other members\' inhumanness like her very low body temperature.\n Star Trek:\n Though most Borg of any sex don\'t look particularly appealing, the Borg queen is decidedly sexier looking than any of her drones. Also, Seven of Nine is quite attractive but only once most of her more Borg-like physical attributes are removed via surgery.\n The Vidiians suffer from a disfiguring disease called the Phage, but strangely the Doctor\'s love interest Denara Pel still retains some of her facial good looks. At least more than any other Vidiian we see.\n In Star Trek VI, Rosanna De Soto\'s Klingon character had much less pronounced brow ridges than most of the male Klingons. But then, so did Christopher Plummer.\n Klingons fall into this trope even in Star Trek: The Original Series. In the episode "Day of the Dove" we get to see both Klingon men and women. The men all have brutish expressions concealed under thick Blackface makeup while the women have spray on tans, and garish blue eye shadow. The retconned explanation for the more humanoid Klingons is that they were engineered to look like humans for easier interaction, so it\'d be logical for the females to be attractive to humans.\n In Supernatural, though they all look human, the male reapers usually look like balding old people that can keel over anytime, while female reapers are all at least conventionally attractive. The first time we see a female reaper it resembles a shade with wild hair. It then disguises itself as a conventional human to interact with Dean and later outright says that a reaper is seen however the reaper chooses to be perceived.\n A common trope with Super Sentai and Power Rangers villainesses. The majority of villain teams are 3-4 male People in Rubber Suits and one hot (and very human) Dark Chick whose monster-ness clearly appears to be worn and not integral. Of Power Rangers series, every season has one except Zeo, Mystic Force, Samurai, Megaforce and Dino Charge - which all still have attractive female villainesses, just of the rubber suit variety. There are even a few Monsters of the Week who might qualify, such as Icy Angel, but they tended to be rare.\n Torchwood features a "sexy" half-transformed Cyberwoman, even though the Cybermen in Doctor Who, whether constructed from men or women, look exactly the same.\n Played with in the famous "Eye of The Beholder" episode of The Twilight Zone (1959). A woman with bandages around her head is repeatedly described as ugly by the people around her. She has undergone plastic surgery to become normal, but at the end the bandages come off and the doctor says the surgery didn\'t work. The twist? The woman is actually beautiful, and the other people are extremely ugly with pig-like faces.\n Wizards of Waverly Place:\n Frankie Stein, who\'s a cute, if very tall, girl with a rubber forehead attachment.\n Alex and Harper when they\'re pretending to be werewolves in "Meet the Werewolves".\n Stargate Atlantis: Elia, the Wraith girl from the episode "Instinct". The unsettling appearance of the life-sucking bug-human hybrid girl can\'t hide Jewel Staite underneath the facial prosthetics. Her caretaker originally decided to raise her as his daughter because he couldn\'t bring himself to kill her.\n In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Raina gains bright gold eyes, a beak-like nose, Pointed Ears and sharp thrones on (and inside) her body after undergoing Terrigenisis. She first perceives it as Body Horror, but as she grows more confident, she begins to own her new look.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n For Finnish monster rock band Lordi, their first pianist, Enary, was a blonde valkyrie who was still gorgeous despite having an extra mouth. They\'ve since averted it with their new pianist, Awa, a ghostly witch who\'s as creepy as they come (although still arguably cuter than most of the male monsters.)\n Teto Kasane from Vocalic is apparently a Chimera.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mythology\xa0\n In at least one source of Classical Mythology (The Ovid), female centaurs are described as being quite comely, in contrast to their more brutish and single-minded men-folk.\n The Asura in Hindu Mythology and Buddhist myth: all the males are ugly and all the females are beautiful. And both are very violent.\n Norse Mythology:\n The jotuns (giants) were typically pretty butt-ugly, but the female jotuns were comely enough that a lot of the Aesir married one (or nine...). Loki is somewhat an exception to this rule, being handsome despite giant ancestry (it\'s not clear whether he is a full or half giant). He\'s also a shapeshifting trickster god, so who knows what he really looks like, and his children were mostly horrible monsters.\n Huldra, nymphs with cow or fox tails (and optionally hollow backs, like a tree trunk), especially since they\'re usually considered to be female trolls.\n Valkyries (like gorgons) are female creatures that were originally hideous but later on became to be known as incredibly beautiful maidens sought after by many a Norse hero (despite the fact that they weren\'t actually human). Also they\'re really only "beasts" depending on your interpretation of their title: Choosers of the Slain.\n Mermaids can be this depending on which myth you follow.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Tabletop Games\xa0\n In Changeling: The Lost a woman who has become a draconic Fairest is this by default, as Fairest are "the fairest of them all", and draconics have aspects of the Great Beasts of Faerie, such as dragons.\n Dungeons & Dragons:\n The supplement Elder Evils has an inversion with the Hulks of Zoretha. The four female hulks resemble bulky, stony giants of no discernible gender. On the other hand the singular male, while roughly the same twenty feet in height as the female hulks, appears as a slender and beautiful winged humanoid if awakened.\n Medusas, unsurprisingly, zigzag depending on the edition. Those in 1st edition were horribly ugly, 2nd edition made them very comely if you could look past the snake hair (without being Taken for Granite), 3rd edition kept the comely bodies but the effect was somewhat marred by the scales and a face that looked like a cross between a viper and a hag, and 4th edition seems to go for a middle-of-the-road approach. Pathfinder (aka D&D 3.75), meanwhile, takes the "playmate with mildly scaly skin and snakes for hair" road.\n Advanced (2nd edition) and 4th edition also features a gender flipped version - there are indeed male Medusas, but apart from being bald, they\'re actually pretty handsome. This is the only way they differ from normal humans in 2e, and 4e\'s versions are scaly like their ladyfolk, so for them the baldness isn\'t that bad).\n The Fiendish Codex: Hordes of the Abyss introduces Obyriths, outrageously bizarre demons (as opposed to the more humanoid Tanar\'ri) whose forms exude such a primal wrongness that looking at them can do permanent damage to your mind. Their queen has a "soft, feminine form," though it would be hard to describe her as cute, but then you find out that that\'s just the veil surrounding her, which formed because the plane of ultimate, horrible madness that spawned her refuses to accept that she is real. If looking at her true form doesn\'t simply kill you, it is because your brain didn\'t register what she looked like in the first place. And if you die from it and get resurrected, you don\'t remember what you saw.\n Pathfinder\'s driders (spider-centaurs) are sexually dimorphic. The females look like beautiful drow women from the waist up (except for the fangs), and their black widow-like lower bodies have a certain elegant sleekness. The males have bulkier and more arachnid features.\n The Kytons, a race of sadomasochistic evil outsiders known as "Chain Devils", were traditionally portrayed as humans wrapped up like mummies in so many layers of chains that nothing can be seen. The Kyton in the Pathfinder Bestiary? Is depicted as a shapely, blue-and-purple-skinned yellow-eyed woman who wears nothing but chains wrapped around her body to just barely hide her face, nipples and loins, leaving the rest of her largely bare. True, her body is also covered in dozens of fine scars, but these are subtle and don\'t really detract from her general attractiveness. Definitely a case of the cute monster girl still acting monstrous, however, as the racial profile as sadomasochistic kidnappers and hedonists remains pretty much identical to earlier editions.\n All editions of the game are chock full of these, including gender-inverted versions. The odds of a Cute Monster Girl or Guy rise exponentially if that creature is being portrayed sympathetically. Tieflings are descended from fiendish creatures and often play this trope straight. Genasi and the various races like them are touched by elemental blood and often depicted as quite attractive. An occasional handsome or Nubile Savage half-orc or even full orc will not surprise players. And then there are the not-that-monstrous sorts like tritons, merfolk, various nymphs, fae, giants, and so on, all of whom have a decent chance to be attractive in human eyes. In short, Beauty Equals Goodness is frequently, but not always, in effect. Evil races get their chances, such as various yuan-ti creations of serpent people. Even demons and devils get in on it. Most versions are horrific, but those specifically intent on seduction and temptation are frequently beautiful. And for a broad enough definition of "Monster," so do the celestial races, as they usually represent angels or even good takes on The Fair Folk (pre-4th Eladrin and Pathfinder\'s Azata).\n Malifaux gives us the Neverborn, a literal race of Nightmares, including Pandora and Lilith, the latter described as "the very image of woman that creation intended, the beautiful vision that haunts the dreams of men", the former only being on the verge of adulthood.\n In Maid RPG, due to the rather random nature of the character generation system, it is very likely that at least one of your maids is gonna end up as one from the start.\n Mortasheen has Mothstrous, a human-moth hybrid who looks quite cute compared to the other human-insect hybrids called Arthropoids, who are grotesque and Brundlefly-ish in look. Given that Mortasheen\'s standards of beauty are... different, it\'s not surprising to learn they consider Mothstrous one of the most hideous and grotesque of all Arthropoids. For comparison\'s sake, this is one of the Arthropoids they consider "beautiful".\n Used to its fullest in the Talislanta game-setting with the Batrean race, whose females are green-haired space babes (except when they\'re blue-haired) with seductive pheromones, and whose males are gangling hairy ogres. Technically also true of the singular race of Gnorls and Weirdlings, although not for the usual reasons: Although Gnorls (the females) look like someone\'s 80-year-old grandma, that\'s still prettier than their male counterparts, the Weirdlings (who look like anorexic Yodas in their skivvies).\n Subverted in Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 with Daemonettes of Slaanesh. While considered to be extremely beauty by anyone who views them, their true appearance is rather nasty (giant crustacean claws are a must) and the desire they exude is a form of Glamour. Slaanesh itself is hermaphroditic and androgynous but is a master of Appearance Is in the Eye of the Beholder, appearing as the pinnacle of beauty by whoever views it... and trapping those who view it to be its servants for all eternity.\n Yu-Gi-Oh!:\n Fabled Krus, who also appears to be a Shrinking Violet.\n The Fascinating Fiend archetype visually resemble young girls in their own artworks, but based on the artwork of "Fascinating Trap Hole", they are either vicious creatures in disguise, or they play bait to trap prey for their "pets."\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theater\xa0\n Kate Monster from Avenue Q was going to have a lot of fuzz, similar to Trekkie Monster, but was shaved before production so she would look better with a male (and human) love interest.\n Magda in Tanz Der Vampire becomes a gorgeous vampiress after she\'s bitten (though some actresses in the part do subvert this by applying some rather distorted makeup after she\'s been turned). In addition, sometimes female chorus vampires fall into this as well. Sarah is one by the end of the show, without exception between actresses. Herbert\'s a rather cute monster boy.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Toys\xa0\n Monster High is Mattel\'s current big hit whose entire line is based off this trope.\n MGA\'s toyline Novi Stars, though they\'re technically Cute Alien Girls.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n Quite a few characters from the Breath of Fire series. Most notably Deis from the first game, Katt from the second game, Momo from the third game and Ursula from the fourth game. Male members of the Blacksmith Clan are hulking minotaur-like strongmen, yet their women look like ordinary humans with horns. Although apparently the women are just as strong, despite this...\n There are three female Splicer bodytypes in BioShock: Ladysmith, Rosebud, and Baby Jane. All male Splicers are uniformly hideous, warped and disfigured by overuse of ADAM. As for the females, there are two aversions and a straight example. The aversions are Ladysmith (an older woman in fancy clothes, her face skeletal and distorted) and Rosebud (modeled after Rosie the Riveter, but with a garish, disgusting tumor growing out of her forehead). Baby Jane, meanwhile, hasn\'t physically mutated at all - her only modifications are some scars and makeup. Sadly, though, ADAM has had its usual effects on her mind...\n Boktai:\n Black Django \u2014 the hero\'s vampiric form \u2014 has pointed ears, fangs, blue skin, and bat wings... making him a Cute Monster Boy.\n Red Durathor from the sequel is fairly cute despite having thorny armored plant-like arms and legs.\n Many of the monsters in the Castlevania games, such as the Succubus, and the Perspherone, a demonic maid who happens to know Kung-Fu. Laura, the vampire child from Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, especially in the Reverie DLC, where she and Gabriel form a strong bond.\n Cthylla in Chaos Code, if one can look past her shark-like dentition and penchant for blowing venomous ink in her opponents\' faces.\n Genovefa in Child of Light is a Fish Person with green skin and small fin-like protrusions spouting from her ears and tail. Contrast with Robert (a bipedal mouse), Oengus (a hulking armor-clad bear-goat-thing), and Golem (a big jagged rock Golem).\n Female vampires, demonesses, cyborg girls, and catgirls are very common in the City of Heroes/City of Villains games. The character creator includes options such as horns, pointy ears, tails, hooved/clawed feet, etc. Even one of the NPC heroines is a catgirl. Also applies to NPC enemies. Most of the various demons the you can fight are grotesque monsters, except for the succubi.\n Dark Souls has a few of these, most notably Priscilla the Crossbreed, a 20 foot tall giant Mystical White Haired girl who happens to be half dragon. Quelaag and her sister are beautiful women with horrible lava spiders for lower bodies.\n Demon\'s Souls has The Fool\'s Idol, which basically looks like a pretty girl with four arms.\n In Darkstalkers, any female character that\'s not Baby Bonnie Hood (Morrigan, Lilith, Felicia, Q-Bee) qualifies, but the winner is Hsien-Ko, a Chinese Vampire. Q-Bee is probably the most horrible, as while her race act like normal bees, they\'ve developed one evolutionary trait to help them hunt their prey: their eyes. Those gigantic bulbs on her head? Those are her real eyes. The ones on the front of her face are there to trick people into thinking she\'s a dimwitted chick. This is why her fighting pose is animated so her head looks like it\'s pointing down, her actual eyes are completely focused on her prey.\n Disgaea:\n Most monsters are male, with the most obvious exceptions being the Succubus and the Nekomata, which are all female.\n The "standard" demon race of the Netherworld have females of several different body types, like valkyries, healers and magic knights (all of them cute).\n Disgaea 2 introduces the Flora Beast (something similar to a Nymph).\n Raspberyl is a Fun Size Cute Monster Girl.\n Disgaea 4 has Desco, the Netherworld\'s most adorable Eldritch Abomination.\n Dragon\'s Crown has harpies and vampires, who look cute but are lethal predators who feed on human victims, as well as a friendly mermaid and fairy.\n DragonFable has ice and water elves, which have sharp, Snape-y faces for the males. Granted, we only see male ice elves, but female water elves are spotted here and there. Unlike the males, they have the same faces as humans, aside from their coral-like horns. (Interestingly enough, wind, wood and dark elves all have human-like faces, though all of them have glowing eyes.)\n The Shura in Dream Of Mirror Online fit - the males are big hulking walls of flesh, with short, fleshy tails, and a (fleshy) horn on their forehead. The females are cat girls.\n Subverted in Earthworm Jim. Jim\'s girlfriend, Princess What\'s-Her-Name, is big-eyed, wasp-waisted (and an insect, haha), and extremely well proportioned. On her homeworld, she\'s considered hideously deformed. Her sister, Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-For-A-Butt, who looks something like a giant termite queen, is the pinnacle of beauty to her people.\n Many enemies in Final Fantasy. The exact specifications vary from game to game, ranging from monsters with female body parts to highly-feminine monsters to monsters that look exactly like humans with maybe one or two monster features. For example, the recurring Lamia enemies are usually snakes with female torsos and faces, and in IV somehow have asses showing through their snake skin.\n Recurring summon Shiva is often depicted as a graceful and well-formed female with a pretty face with her body covered by nothing but ribbons or growths of ice. She also has blue skin and lips, due to being An Ice Person, and often has other body features to betray her monstrous nature.\n Ditto for Siren, though she doesn\'t appear in as many games. Her FF8 incarnation is the straightest example. She is a beautiful woman with strategically placed feathers on her body, and bird wings coming out of her head.\n Terra of Final Fantasy VI is a half-human and half-Esper, and was pointedly not this in her original game, her Esper form was emphasized to be feral and monstrous and it terrified people. Then Dissidia came along and look at her now\u25ca. While that is a valid interpretation of her in-game sprites from FF6\u25ca, bear in mind that this\u25ca was the original character design. Her alt outfits also provide you options in your fanservice by recoloring her pink, blue and green.\n One may cynically note that the male Espers in VI are monstrous and highly varied, but the female Espers are all attractive half-naked women, maybe with wings or blue skin if you\'re lucky. Terra\'s unusually monstrous by the standards of female Espers.\n The Cloud of Darkness, also from Dissidia, is a Made of Evil Eldritch Abomination who wants to engulf the world in darkness and is an eternal entity unable to ever be destroyed, only defeated and put to sleep until it rises again. And oh yes, it looks like this\u25ca. The games state that as a force of nature it has no true form and has no gender, it just chooses to appear as a female. Convenient.\n The Nymphs from Final Fantasy IX. They have completely humanoid (and scantily clad) bodies, simply with what looks like grass and leaves for hair. The villainous ones have purple skin while the good ones have green skin but they\'re still pretty hot.\n The Vieras and the Grias from games set in Ivalice. The Viera are tall, ebony-skinned warrior women with bunny ears and Stripperific clothing, and the Gria are incredibly cute female dragon-like humanoids with wings and horns. The Seeq avert this: the couple female Seeq NPCs look almost identical to male Seeq.\n The two female Espers in Final Fantasy XII. Shemhazai\'s face is not visible, but she does have a scantily clad fanservice-y body. Ultima is also quite attractive if one ignores her teal skin.\n Fire Emblem\n In Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, most of the Dragon shapeshifters known as Manaketes are unattractive Old Men with Fangs, inhuman skintone, Claws, and leathery Wings. However one of the playable Manaketes, Tiki, merely looks like a little girl with Pointy Ears, sometimes with feathery wings. Xane, a Manakete Male, who lost his dragon form, also fits as a rare aversion as he looks like an ordinary human Bishounen, being one of the only Male Manaketes to be young or attractive.\n Half Manakete Siblings Ninian and Nils in Blazing Sword; Ninian is beautiful and ethereal, while Nils fits the "cute child growing into a handsome young man" role.\n While the Laguz females in Fire Emblem Tellius are quite attractive, the males are just as commonly attractive as well.\n The aforementioned Tiki returns in Fire Emblem Awakening, and is joined by manakete and expy, Nowi and as well as Nowi\'s daughter Nah, and Morgan with a Manakete. The game also introduced Taguel, which are heavily based on the beast Laguz, the first playable character in it, Panne fits this and so does Morgan if a male Avatar marries Panne. Yarne is a Cute Monster Boy, and so is Morgan if a female Avatar marries him. Manakete Morgan, however, can only be female, fitting this trope. The only Male Dragon tribe member in the game, Grima, is monstrous, and never assumes a humanoid form.\n Five characters fall under this trope in Fire Emblem Fates. The first and second of which are the playable Avatar (especially if female) and Kana (especially if female, which requires the Avatar to be Male), similar to the manakete in that they are half dragon. Another dragon named Lilith appears. The three of them look very different from how usual dragons do. The remaining two are Selkie and Velouria (along with their fathers), each exclusive to Hoshido and Nohr (respectively) and both being available in the third path.\n Played straight in Gears of War 2 to the surprise of everyone (including Delta squad, Cole saying: "I thought she was supposed to be butt ugly."), with the Locust Queen, who appears almost exactly like a human woman (albeit wearing a squid on her back and a kinda grey skin tone). It turns out Myrrah actually is a mutated human.\n Golden Sun:\n The Fire Clan are mostly human-looking with some draconic traits, such as scales, colorful skin, equally colorful hair, and Pointy Ears. But then there\'s Karst, who pairs all of that with the appearance of a cute teenager and a black leather micromini.\n Golden Sun: Dark Dawn\'s beastmen are all quite furry and a bit more animalistic than your average Cat Girl. And then there\'s Sveta, who is very human-looking, not readily identifiable as anything but "furry" (and her fur is skin-tone!), and very moe. Compare her with her brother, who has a very distinct muzzle (and blue fur, though beastman colors run the gamut). She can enter a more beastly form, which is largely indistinguishable from the werewolf/wolfman monsters (it\'s also a bit of a Game Breaker).\n Grandia:\n From the original Grandia, a character named Milda joins your team. She\'s an older (beast)woman who, though not necessarily cute, has curves in all the right places and is marred only by having horns, sharp teeth, and a tufted tail. Eventually you reach the village where her tribe lives and get to see the men\u2014 all of whom are BIPEDAL COWS.\n In Grandia II, a large, ugly, male beastman named Marag joins your party early on. This isn\'t so bad until you visit his village later in the game and find out that, apparently, the rest of his species is comprised of cute and/or hot Cat Girls.\n The House of the Dead EX has Zobiko, a Cute Zombie Girl. She\'s also one of the main characters.\n Kid Icarus:\n Medusa is a cyclops stone head in a wall, but after being damaged enough she turns into a human sized attractive Medusa (her original form according to the story) right before dying. She\'s even more of this in Kid Icarus: Uprising for 3DS (just look at her\u25ca). Once she\'s nearly dead, though, she reveals what she actually looks like. It\'s quite horrifying.\n The Syren enemy, who has full frontal NES nudity. The manual warns not to be caught unaware by her female form, as she is pure evil.\n In King\'s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, princess Rosella is transformed into a troll but retains some of her beauty, making her the cutest troll girl around.\n Knights of the Old Republic has Juhani\u25ca, a Cat Girl who looks... very different from every other Cathar\u25ca in all of Star Wars. Handwaved later by making Juhani a member of a rare Cathar subspecies, yet the more common version of a female Cathar still look much nicer than the hulking tiger-men that are the males\u25ca.\n Tiamat from La-Mulana. Then she starts kicking your ass, and you somehow stop finding her cute. Then you start kicking her ass, and she gets downright ugly. (In the PC version anyway; in the Wii version all she gets is a scowl.)\n The Legend of Zelda:\n Yeto of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a big, hulking yeti with a face that one would expect a yeti to have. His wife Yeta, on the other hand, is a walking ball of fur (or clothes, it\'s hard to tell) with a much cuter face. At least when she\'s not possessed by the dungeon boss, then her face goes all scary-like...\n The eponymous Twilight Princess: regular twilight citizens aren\'t so much ugly as featureless (most of them being black mannequin-like when not under Zant\'s curse) she\'s absolutely gorgeous and looks mostly like a woman with a weird skin-tone.\n The Zoras are an odd case in Twilight Princess. Most of them look the same, with no sexual dimorphism and being very androgynous. Some of them wear fish-like helmets, but their real faces are rather human. The Zora Queen Rutela, on the other hand, is much more human-like, with a distinct bust and something hairlike on her head.\n Ruto grows into this after the Time Skip in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n [adult swim] Flash Game Lesbian Spider Queens Of Mars has, well, the lesbian Spider Queen of Mars(it\'s the lower half that\'s a spider).\n Lineage II: The Chaotic Throne: Male dwarves look like their counterparts in WoW and similar games... but female dwarves look like baby-faced teenage jockettes, scaled down to size. (They also narrowly skirt the Uncanny Valley.)\n In Might & Magic VII goblins are available as a Player Character race; both the female ones available for your party and the NPC ones you meet in Deja and the Pit are attractive in their own way.\n The H-Game Visual Novel Monster Girl Quest is filled with these. They are actually all a nation of different One-Gender Race monsters who rely on human males to reproduce and as a food source. They range from this to downright terrifying.\n The Pixie species from Monster Rancher is a race of cute, impish girls with demon horns, wings, tails, and Cute Little Fangs. It\'s implied in some games that they are Always Female, but the names bestowed on some Pixie NPC monsters seems to suggest that there are some males\u2014they just look exactly the same as the females.\n Sheeva, Goro\'s Distaff Counterpart from Mortal Kombat. Despite being a female Shokkan who\'s incredibly tall, very muscular, four-armed, and the type who\'s more than willing to beat enemies to a pulp, she gets more attention from the fans than one would think.\n In Dragon Ball Online and Dragon Ball Xenoverse, female Majins look more like Distaff Counterparts to Super Buu: they are slimmer, have feminine features, and more humanoid faces compared to the males of their race, who are large and rotund with more cartoonish faces. Justified in-universe as Majin Buu having created the first female Majin after being inspired by a dirty book.\n In Neo Steam, the male Beast races are huge hulking wolf-men or bear-men, depending on faction. Their female counter-part race are small, slender, curvy catgirls with cute stubby tails.\n Neverwinter Nights:\n The tiefling Valen of the Hordes of the Underdark expansion is male example, being uncharacteristically attractive for a fiend.\n Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer gives us another male example in Gannayev, a Hagspawn, which are male Hag/Human hybrids and typically look something like this\u25ca. Gann, on the hand, looks like this\u25ca. Most people in the fandom adamantly refused to believe that this was the official character portrait of Gann because, really, there was absolutely no justifiable way a Hagspawn could look that pretty until actually playing the game, where it was revealed that his looks resulted from the love his parents had for each other.\n Neeshka. A tiefling rogue in Neverwinter Nights 2 with horns and (provided the game is updated) a tail. Considered by many fans to be the cutest girl in the game, Neeshka and a male main character is the Fan-Preferred Couple to such an extent that an add-on module has been released to reinstate her as a romance option, after it was cut during development due to time restraints.\n Ellen and Tammy from Pale Blue. In contrast to most examples however they play much more on the monster aspect.\n The MMORPG Perfect World has the race called the Untamed. The males are big muscular furries, entirely hairy and with animal heads, and the females slender Cat Girls (or fox-, demon-, etc.), with tails and a second set of ears or something similar on the sides of their heads, but otherwise as humans.\n Phantasy Star has this in spades. PSII had Nei, PSIV had Rika and Demi, and by PSO, Numans were a full-fledged minority within the population of Pioneer 2.\n Planescape: Torment:\n A number of odd NPCs can be added to your party. Only two are female, and both of them are conventionally very attractive, with some add-ons (a tail in the case of Annah and wings in the case of Fall-From-Grace). With Grace it\'s expected; she is a succubus. However, Annah is a tiefling; that is, someone descended from a fiendish grandparent (possibly with a few "greats" thrown in), and most fiends in Dungeons & Dragons, even female ones, aren\'t very attractive. Annah also wears a leather version of a Breast Plate, including hooker boots. The PC can hang a lampshade on this by suggesting she strip it down further, adding a few more slashes, to distract her marks. She gets flustered by this remark, and he comments he thought that\'s what it was for in the first place. She claims she gets hot, and "suspects it\'s the fiend blood in me".\n The Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts, where you find Fall-From-Grace, is full of these. It is, after all, still a whorehouse in Sigil, even if it offers strictly non-physical intimacies. There\'s Marissa the medusa, the extremely voluptuous "planetouched" Kesai-Serris note\xa0 she\'s a half-Night Hag tiefling: her dad was a Cambion, a half-demon, mom was Ravel Puzzlewell the Night Hag, Kimasxi Adder-Tongue the tiefling (though a scruffy and abrasive one, kept on as a sort of verbal dominatrix), and Dolora the very well-built golem, most obviously, but it can be inferred most (or all) of the other six prostitutes are inhuman as well.\n Pok\xe9mon:\n Gardevoir and Lopunny, which admittedly look the same regardless if they are male or female. Gardevoir\'s pre-evolved form, Kirlia, is a Cute Monster Little Girl, and Gardevoir also has its male counterpart, Gallade.\n Several other Pok\xe9mon seem to be this (though again they appear identical regardless of gender), including Ninetales, Mismagius, Mawile, Gothitelle and Froslass. Froslass is only female.\n Bellossom, Roselia, Roserade, Lilligant, and Florges can be seen as Cute Plant Girls, while Leavanny and Illumise are Cute Bug Girls.\n Legendary Pok\xe9mon Diancie is genderless (not to mention part-Rock), but it looks feminine, and adorable.\n By allowing monster all its "Cute Monster Girl" mons to be male or female, Pokemon rather subverts this trope. Likewise musclebound monsters like the Machop and Timburr lines can be male female.\n Primal gives us little Elizabeth in the realm of Aetha since the inhabitants of this realm are all zombies/vampires. She loves to dance and carries a dead rat as if it were a plush toy.\n Queen\'s Blade video games have Gal Monsters that can be caught and fight for the player.\n The female Satyros from Radiant Historia, especially Aht.\n Ragnarok Online has a lot of these. Some examples: Maya, Moonlight Flower, Loli Ruri, Succubus, Valkyrie, Isis, Alice, Aliza. There are also many male examples.\n In Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell, Jezebel is absolutely adorable! Even if she is Satan\'s daughter.\n In the first Shadow Hearts game male Harmonixer Yuri Hyuga transforms into almost completely inhuman monstrosities when he fuses with a monster soul- he\'ll usually still have 2 arms and 2 legs (usually), but only Seraphic Radiance/Dark Seraphim looks even remotely human- and it still has eerie pale skin and giant black wings. On the other hand, in Shadow Hearts: From the New World, hot female harmonixer Shania transforms into beautiful non-human creatures which are still abundantly female and wearing even less than she usually does. Yuri hits the middle ground, however, with his Level 1 Fusions in Shadow Hearts: Covenant, which are generally attractive male non-human creatures wearing less than Yuri usually does.\n The default character portraits for Trolls and Orks in Shadowrun Returns include some Cute Monster Girls and Cute Monster Boys, though they run the full range from "cute if you don\'t mind fangs/horns" to "not conventionally attractive, but still mostly human-looking except for the obvious bits that distinguish them from baseline humans" to "outright monstrous." This is completely in line with the original tabletop lore.\n A large number of the enemies and villains in Shantae are Cute Monster Girls. Among them: Cute Scorpion-Girls, Cute Water Lobster Thing Girls, Cute Snake Girls, and Cute Zombie Girls.\n Shin Megami Tensei:\n Most, if not all, the female demons and deities, especially Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, as even the ones who are officially supposed to be hideous still manage to look really sexy (with perhaps the only exception definitely being the "Old Hag" type of demoness).\n Mother Harlot has a pretty nice body. Her face, on the other hand, could use some work.\u25ca\n The kid-friendly spinoff DemiKids takes this to an utterly ridiculous degree with some of its designs. Some are sort of logical, but others, like the Banshee and Harpy, are a bit of stretch. They even managed to turn Dullahan (a Headless Horseman who rides on a similarly headless horse and functions as an omen of death) into one of them. Take a look.\n Shin Megami Tensei IV uses this for a number of the old standards, but subverts it hard with some of the redesigns, especially for Lilith. You know how Lilith used to look like Gozer with a snake around her neck? Not anymore.\n The Dagonian race of Fish People in Skullgirls are often more fish than human looking, but minor character Minette looks like a human girl with a tadpole tail for hair. There\'s also Squigly, who\'s remarkably cute for a zombie.\n StarCraft has the Zerg Queen of Blades, Sarah Kerrigan. For someone who\'s been infested by The Virus she\'s still smokin\' hot, but much of this is due to Art Evolution. In Brood War\'s cinematics and menus, Kerrigan looked like this\u25ca and this\u25ca. Nowadays her appearance is locked onto this\u25ca. It\'s also lampshaded in-universe that her beautiful human face has mostly been unaffected by infestation, and is another tool she can rely on to distract an enemy if she\'s ever in close-quarters combat.\n Tales Series:\n Tales of Symphonia has The Mandragora/Alraune enemies, which are just humans with green hair and flowers growing out of their heads. Dawn of the New World makes them look significantly more inhuman, though. Others included the Lamia/Medusas, Harpy/Feather Magics, Amphitra/Mermaid/Sea Horrors, and potentially the angels and summon guardians.\n Fenia from Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World; the best mage monster in the game, talks, and plays this trope perfectly straight.\n Tales of Rebirth plays this straight and averts it with Hilda, a Gajuma-Huma half-breed. In-universe, Hilda\'s horns made her appear to be an ugly freak, but anyone can see that Hilda is attractive with or without the horns.\n Nearly every single Touhou character (and there are a lot) is one of these, with Little Bit Beastly individuals rampant, and some of the most horrendous youkai appearing almost indistinguishable to humans. For only some examples, Nitori is supposed to be a kappa, Aya and Hatate are supposed to be (crow) tengu, Mamizou is a tanuki, Satori and Koishi are supposed to be Satori, and Yamame is meant to be a Giant Spider, and yet at most they only have one or two features that indicate them as such. The few male characters in the series tend to appear more monstrous (and old), with Genji being a talking turtle and Unzan being a cloud. There are occasional subversions, like Kogasa (a karakasa who is explicitly both the girl with the blue dress and the umbrella she\'s holding) and the bestial youkai rabbit in one of Maribel\'s dream-excursions, and very few of them act cute, most of them being violent bigoted jerks who are not above threatening to eat the protagonist. Played with by Nue, who is embarassed by how unscary her Shapeshifter Default Form is and goes to great lengths to hide it.\n Every character that isn\'t the Player Character or Chara, the other fallen human in Undertale is a monster, and while their designs vary, this trope is generally in effect for monsters of both genders, particularly for major characters. Undyne is basically a female human with scales, fangs, and a few fins (she also has an Eyepatch of Power and a long red ponytail) and Dr. Alphys is a dorky, anime-obsessed bipedal yellow lizard with Nerd Glasses and a Labcoat of Science and Medicine. Muffet is a spider-girl who resembles a grey-skinned humanoid girl in a Victorian tea-party outfit with extra limbs, eyes, and Cute Little Fangs. On the male side we have Papyrus, a goofy skeleton dressed in an elaborate costume, and his lackadaisical brother Sans. Both Toriel and Asgore are older than usual for this trope\u2014both are basically middle-aged\u2014but resemble tall goat-like humanoids with friendly faces and white fur, and both have their fans in-universe and out. Mettaton seems to defy this, as despite being the underground\'s closest thing to a sex symbol he\'s just a boxy robot who is little more than a TV screen on a wheel,  but his alternate forms are androgynous robo-Bishonens.\n The female Draken of WildStar are, both in-universe and out of it, renowned for their attractive appearance. That they could and probably will murder you in an instant doesn\'t ruin the attraction one iota\u2014you could even say it helps.\n In World of Warcraft, the female members of "monstrous" races look like models with paint jobs and funny hairdos, while the male members are considerably fuglier. They also tend to be rather well endowed.\n Females of the minotaur-like Tauren are pretty heavily built, true... but they\'re still utterly slender and feminine compared to the massive bulls.\n Female orcs and trolls have perfect posture compared to their hunched-over male counterparts, with slimmer builds (though female orcs are still relatively muscular) and less pronounced tusks. While the NPCs in the game have a variety of appearances, character creation provides 1 conventionally attractive face option for both, jokingly known as "Cutefase" (sic). The vast majority of female orc/troll player characters have these faces. With orcs, it\'s particularly bad because they only have one non-barbaric hairstyle as well. Meaning if you want to make a "pretty" orc girl, you will end up with the same face and hair as everyone else. Thankfully, the Barbershop expanded the hair options for fashion-conscious orc and troll ladies.\n The Naga, a race of Snake People. The women are slender with noticeably elven facial features (they used to be night elves). The men, however, are bulkier and more bestial in appearance, with fully dragon-like heads. It\'s also implied that the men are less intelligent as well.\n Draenei females are approximately half the mass of their male counterparts, their tails and facial tendrils are far more understated, and they lack the weirdly shaped forehead bone that makes the face look less human. On the other hand, they\'re less human than the male draenei in a sexiness-enhancing way: the males just have a human, straight-backed posture, but the females\' hooves give them a "high heels" posture that pushed the chest forward and the hips back. Even in-universe, female draenei are renowned for their beauty.\n If you look at the female worgen as they are, you might not think the trope is in effect, as they do look like werewolves. However, compared to the old proposed model \u2014 more stooped, less curvy \u2014 you can see the logic of this trope has had an effect. Apparently customers just didn\'t like the "monsters not looking like supermodels" thing.\n The Forsaken, with the obvious exception of their queen Sylvanas Windrunner, somewhat downplay this. While female Forsaken do look less ugly than their male counterpart, they still have the same decaying parts and somewhat hunchback stance, their chest is much less pronounced than for other races, and they overall tend to inspire more Uncanny Valley rather than Fetish Fuel.\n The 3rd-person MOBA Smite loves this trope. While male deities can range from human to positively monstrous, many of the female deities are almost universally beautiful women with various costume additions, with a few exceptions. Special mention should be made to Scylla for toying with this trope: she\'s depicted as a cute little girl in a dress with a mischievous smile...and four horrific dog-headed serpent-tentacles instead of legs!\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Visual Novels\xa0\n Hanyuu from Higurashi: When They Cry has a pair of horns, one of which is slightly chipped. She\'s actually a subversion; before becoming a god, she was a human who just so happened to be born with horns, hinted to be because of a genetic defect. Her horns were the main reason she was chosen to be a sacrifice.\n Saya from Saya no Uta is a deconstruction, since she is an Eldritch Abomination. Her true form is never fully revealed, but it\'s implied to be the farthest thing from cute, since any normal person who sees her is driven insane. The only reason the protagonist sees her as attractive is because of an extreme case of agnosia that causes him to see everything as hideous, and the only truly hideous thing in his life as beautiful.\n Tsukihime: Akiha is pretty cute, there\'s Arcueid, and Nanako is a half human half unicorn spirit that\'s the Moe Anthropomorphism of the Seventh Scripture.\n Love At First Sight centers around Sachi Usui, a shy and physically-battered cyclops who suffers from bullying.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Webcomics\xa0\n 565-14 in Allen The Alien is a cute young alien girl, but she is too young to be a Green-Skinned Space Babe.\n In Baskets of Guts most of the female cast are this.\n Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire has Hyraxx D\'mofiti as well as some of the girls employed at the Velvet Fist.\n The demon heroine Raven in Demonology 101 is a cute teenage girl whose only demonic attributes are reddish eyes and oddly shaped ears (in her case Raven is only a half-demon). The other demons portrayed (both male and female) are also fairly human-looking (and usually somewhat attractive).\n All orcs in Dominic Deegan look close enough to humans to be mutually attractive once you get past the Cute Little Fangs (played straight with Luna, who is fully human and has fangs) and, yes, the green skin. This applies to both male and female orcs, however.\n Eerie Cuties has this title for a reason. The comic centers on a monster highschool, and so far, with the exception of a pair of lizard boys, they are all cute monster girls (and boys). And if the cast isn\'t enough, there are more of them in flashbacks \u2014 hilariously cute snake-girls and so on.\n Grace Sciuridae/Shade Tail in El Goonish Shive is a genetically engineered shapeshifting assassin created to fight the Big Bad Damien. However, she proves to be a pacifist by nature except under the worst provocation. (Her brothers are less human-looking in their hybrid forms, though they can appear human, and quite good-looking, when they choose.) Her male Evil Counterpart from another dimension is much scarier.\n Far Out There temporarily turned several female characters into these in order to celebrate Page 666.\n Ambrosia Verdandi from Fetch Quest: Saga of the Twelve Artifacts. She\'s also a doctor wannabe!\n Nitrine of Flaky Pastry is a small, cute human-looking young woman with green hair and lips. She is also a goblin and has had some rather classical male goblins hanging around.\n Girl Genius got a few:\n Traveling jager-kin Jenka, who gets a lot cuter once she\'s dressed for her job as the head of the Mechanicsburg Diplomatic Corps.\n Ferretina the Evil Weasel Queen from the side-story "Revenge of the Weasel Queen".\n Mamma Gkika; "cute" and "girl" definitely aren\'t the words for her, but she fits all the same.\n Nobody\'s really sure what the Geisterdamen are, other than creepy, but they\'re also kinda hot.\n Maxim and Oggie fall under the heading of Cute Monster Boys.\n Goblins has Saves-a-Fox (admittedly she wears a wig, but still...) and yuan-ti girl Kin. Female Goblins are drawn sexier than their male counterparts in several panels, especially when the male leads are fantasizing.\n Homestuck:\n The trolls fame have grey skin, orange, sunken eyes, fangs of varying length and horns of varying shape. Apart from that, they don\'t really look that monstrous. Nepeta, for example, is adorable, even if she does kill wild animals for food with her bare hands and paint the walls of her cave with their blood. The male trolls are all mostly Cute Monster Guys, too. Except maybe Equius.\n Jade Harley was spliced with a godlike dog, but the doggy features are cosmetic accessories to her big-eyed Moe face, and her plain long hair became a wavy mane.\n One of the primary facets in the mad science comedy The Horrifying Experiments of Dr. Pleasant!. But as the "Schneidecker-Loli principle" clearly states, young females are the easiest to revive.\n Snapdragon Fahrenheit, along with a number of other students (including a gorgon, a succubus and a Jotun) at the Doc Mars Academy from How To Raise Your Teenage Dragon.\n Molly in The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob! is an extremely cute pink furry monster. Princess Voluptua still manages to be pretty attractive even in her insect form, as well.\n Hala River from Irregular Elis is an alien.\n Keychain of Creation has both Marena (Lunar Exalted, \'foxy\', and arguably the Ms. Fanservice of the strip) and Secret (Abyssal Exalted and thus effectively a kind of undead, but undeniably cute). And if a Genius Ditz robotic mad scientist who can turn into a giant robot cat is more your thing, there\'s always Elegant Nova of Progression.\n Benn\'Joon of Looking for Group. What exactly Benny\'s race is is unclear to the point that Richard describes her as "miscellaneous," although she has been on a couple occasions been identified as a troll (whose males, for the record, are green-skinned and generally ugly) and has been regularly called a half-breed. It is later heavily implied that her mother is the quite attractive Elven pirate Captain Tah\'Vraay, so Benny appears to be at least part Elf. The markings around her eyes and three-digit hands similar to the Minotaurs hints that she may very well be Krunch\'s biological daughter.\n The unnamed gorgon protagonist in Modest Medusa seems to be a cute and fairly harmless child, without the ability to turn people to stone or the aggression normally associated with the medusa/gorgon type of monster. Instead she\'s easily distracted and seems to enjoy video games and junk food.\n All the female cast (and males) from Monsterful. Cute monster girl extras (both young and mature) are everywhere, and cute monster girl celebrity parodies!\n Nerf NOW!! has Cute Zerg Girls. As in, the Zerg from StarCraft.\n The Order of the Stick:\n Therkla, a half-orc ninja. While the males of the orcs we see aren\'t exactly any more ugly, mishappen, or inhuman than the females, this could be a limitation of the art style.\n Subverted and parodied in with a female Lizardfolk prostitute. At first she appears to look much more human than a typical member of her species, with blonde hair and Non-Mammal Mammaries. But it turns out these are a wig and implants, which she got to attract more business. Without them she\'d look just like a standard Lizardfolk. (And the other lizardfolk hooker is disgusted by her.)\n Ow, my sanity is about Eldritch Abominations forming an Unwanted Harem around the protagonist, David. All of them take the form of beautiful women or Cute Monster Girls. Notably, the shoggoth manages to look cute even when in its favoured form of a girl with snake-ish mouths for arms!\n Paranormal Mystery Squad:\n The Deer Woman (based on Native American mythos) at the begining was kinda cute if you don\'t notice that her long skirt concealed deer legs. To bad she had already murdered 7 men before being made a foot shorter.\n Once Katie is changed, she is a cute litte werewolf after her bite.\n Soraya from Poharex combines this with Lizard Folk.\n Most of the coatlaltec girls from Restaurante Macoatl fit this trope, the only trace of them being reptiles are their tails and claws.\n Mentioned occasionally in Schlock Mercenary.\n "You \'member dem comics where da alien girls were all pretty an\' stuff?" "Comic book artists don\' get out much, I don\' think."\n "Are there aliens in the company? Are any of \'em... you know... hot?"\n All of the main characters in School Bites are cute vampire girls, some going into the catgirl variety.\n The title character of Selkie has gray skin, flippers, and fangs.\n In Shadowgirls, Christmas Snow\'s mother is a female Deep One, but not nearly as grotesque as one of the originals. This lends a bit of plausibility to the strip showing that she and her human partner conceived her out of mutual love and attraction.\n Sinfest has Baby Blue and Fuchsia. They\'re Devil Girls (presumably succubi), so there\'s some justification for this. Also, their boss is depicted as pretty handsome.\n Sluggy Freelance:\n Parodied in the Years of Yarncraft storyline, especially in this strip.\n Aylee adopts her forms to defend against specific dangers (such as developing mind-shielding with a telepathic foe around). The current form was taken because she feared what humans would do unless she could fit in among them better. In other words, she (subconsciously) made herself into a Cute Monster Girl to gain acceptance.\n Spinnerette gives us Minerva, a Stripperiffic anthropomorphic Cerberus whose three heads offer something for everyone into anthros, whether they like their girls sweet, spicy, or tsundere. There\'s also Katt o\'Nine Tails (though she\'s much more slender than curvy, and her usual outfit is about as far from stripperiffic as you can get) and Evil Spinnerette, who started out human but used a ritual to turn herself into a drider.\n The Creo in Terinu start out as petite and cute when they\'re young, but upon reaching adulthood they gain the same bulky musculature as a male. Ferin does and bucks, on the other hand, retain disturbingly small and cute their entire lives, even as they sported spiky horns and tails.\n Anak Zahard from Tower of God is a cute specimen from the Lizard Folk.\n Whats Shakin has a few, most notably an undead lady Ell and an orc girl Pai.\n Xan from Winters In Lavelle is a male example of this. Half-deer, part of a species infamous for hating humans and being rather violent, but damn, if he isn\'t adorable. And despite his usually less than kind demeanour, his occasional sweet moments (almost always with Rio) only serve to emphasise that.\n The Wotch has Ti\'el, a cute green-haired alien with tentacle hands, and Myrrh, Lord Sykos\' half-liquid maid. Due to the Shapeshifting that goes on, many characters have been a Cute Monster Girl at least once or twice.\n The webcomic "Monster Girls on Tour." has a wide cast of this creatures, with a Salamander as the main one.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n The ghost girl from Baman Piderman.\n Bay 12 Monster Girls is essentially entire world of them. And so it\'s sequel.\n The Lampyrians from Beyond the Impossible. Blue skin, no nose and large bat-like wings. They are exclusively female, live only for two years and are universally considered incredibly attractive.\n Felarya is based on this trope. Almost all major characters are Cute Monster Girls - sweet, innocent, and with an appetite for gulping down humans whole and alive. Felaryan Cute Monster Girls range from nagas (giant snake-human hybrids) to driders (giant spider-human hybrids), mermaids, slug girls, and adorable carnivorous fairies. Who, naturally, are often really, really big and all trying to eat you. Giant males are presumed to exist, but are rarely seen. Some species are One Gender Races.\n The flash cartoon series Primal War is notorious/loved by teenage boys for its cartoony, monstrous males being drastically different to their more human-like and realistically proportioned females for both the beast and dino races.\n The Jade Regent Campaign from RPGMP3 features a character called Misty the Succubus. Misty is a bubbly, bouncy, charmingly na\xefve teenage girl with talents that make her invaluable to the team. She also happens to be a demonic Succubus from the deepest pits of the Abyss, who enjoys long walks on the beaches by the lakes of fire and brimstone, and occasionally starts singing while disemboweling people with her claws. She\'s really a very nice person, once you get to know her.\n While there\'s no images of her on the website, SCP-811 of the SCP Foundation gives of the feel of this trope due to her simplistic third-person manner of speech and her child-like cheerfulness when she learns new things. It probably also helps that she used to be a human being.\n The Spider Cliff Mysteries: Crystal (demon) and Annabelle (zombie).\n Teto Kasane the UTAUloid is a chimera with the appearance of a human girl with bat wings, and is often depicted with Cute Little Fangs depending on the artist. Depictions showing her wings are exceedingly rare, making this somewhat of an Informed Attribute.\n The waiter-zombie users play as in the iTunes app Zombies A La Mode is a cross between a rare cute monster guy and Ugly Cute.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Adventure Time has Princess Bubblegum (a candy person made of gum), Flame Princess (a fire elemental), and Marceline (a shapeshifting vampirised half-demon Half-Human Hybrid). Flame Princess and Princess Bubblegum are the most extreme examples, as the other (mostly male) fire elementals and Candy People look much less humanoid than they do. However, other female characters and creatures are varying flavours of weird; Lumpy Space Princess, for example, is basically a sapient cloud. In the Gender Flip episodes Ice Queen is very much less repulsive than the Ice King, but most likely this is due to her being Ice King\'s self insert.\n Due to the fact that the cast has Loads and Loads of Characters. there are a few more. However, they\'re still outnumbered by the weird ones.\n In The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes!, Wasp becomes one when she\'s mutated by Gamma Radiation.\n Attea from Ben 10: Omniverse. In her first appearance back in Alien Force she was an adorable looking (if bratty and insane) frog girl. Then she popped back up in Omniverse looking like this.\u25ca\n Teryx on Dinosaucers is an evolved Archaeopteryx and beautiful in her own way, so much that several members of her species (even the Big Bad of the show) are attracted to her. In one episode it is revealed that she was an actress in a soap opera on her home planet before joining the hero team, and had hordes of admirers.\n Duck Dodgers:\n It seems that while male Martians are short and cartoony the females, particularly Queen Tyr\'ahnee are, well, this\u25ca. Then again, the male Martian General Z9 is tall and well-built, so it\'s possible that Marvin is just a midget among his people.\n One episode had the hero crash-land onto a planet made up of attractive bug-like women... until the sun goes down.\n Leela from Futurama, a beautiful one-eyed woman descended from a race inflicted with all kinds of Body Horror, is a particularly justified example: her parents and people are formerly human, subterranean mutants and the fact that she happened to be born looking almost human is why they were able to pass her off as a Human Alien and send her to the surface world for a better life than they could give her. Averted with plenty of underground female mutants though. Such deformities include slimy green skin, vertical mouths, extra arms and tentacles.\n All of the female Gargoyles shown in the original TV series are sexy winged humanoids, except for Una, who resembles an anthropomorphic unicorn and is thus still "cute", while male gargoyles have many other types. However, the comic continuation eventually introduced Constance (Coco), a heavy-set female who resembles a wild sow, and Brooklyn\'s mate at the end of his Timedance, Katana, has a face that includes a beautiful beak. In "The Mirror", when Puck turned Elisa into a gargoyle, Elisa qualified for this \u2014 though Goliath considered her more beautiful as a human.\n Generator Rex has Breach, a pale, four-armed (with the top set of arms being abnormally huge) schoolgirl. A later episode introduced Cricket, a girl who\'s still pretty cute despite being green and having spines on her arms. Later episodes reduce the amount of spines, make her figure fuller, and give her a cuter face.\n The Grim Adventuresof Billyand Mandy has two male examples:\n Nergal Jr. has a huge number of fangirls because, while monstrous (and sometimes a Yandere), he is Adorkable.\n A zig-zagged example would be Irwin; he starts of an ordinary, harmless nerd. He later turns out to be a vampire-mummy. Either way, he\'s in the same Adorkable boat as Junior.\n Gumby is guilty of this one. Gumby has roughly the same slab-shaped body as his father, but his mother has a round head with blonde hair on a body that has breasts. And she wears clothes. She\'s not cute by the standards of most entries on this page, but she\'s far more human-shaped than the rest of her family.\n Saffi from Jimmy Two-Shoes, with one eye, orange skin, and Hartman Hips, and Heloise may count, given her Ambiguously Human status. A few background characters qualify as well.\n Plenty of the girls from Lloyd in Space. Alpha Bitch Brittany has blue skin and six arms but is still pretty cute. Dandere Violet simply has yellow skin and pink hair. Cindy may have two heads but one of them is very pretty and her body is also quite nice. Lloyd\'s mother Nora pretty much qualifies for Green-Skinned Space Babe. And one episode has Eddie (the Token Human) falling for a girl who is half-Zebra at the end. Averted with other girls such as Genevieve, Megan, Grace, Charmaine and Mrs Bolts (who is a robot) who have much more alien appearances.\n Martin Mystery has Diana becoming a half-lizard girl in the second part of the third season finale. The eponymous character even jokingly compliments that she\'s only a mini-mutant because her eyes changed and she has a tail.\n Queen Chrysalis from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Most changelings shown look like fanged bald bug versions of ponies with holes in their legs and fins for manes, but the changeling Queen could pass for a gothic supermodel... by pony standards, anyway.\n And then there\'s Fluttershy becoming Flutterbat...\n Iris from Ruby Gloom.\n Sabrina: The Animated Series:\n The group get sucked into Harvey\'s comic book world and Sabrina becomes Calamari Queen, who is half girl, half squid and pretty darn cute. She also appears to have been aged a few years judging by her chest area.\n Grimadonna the vampire superstar from the Netherworld. A sexy humanoid woman just with purple hair, pointy ears, blue skin and fangs.\n Scooby-Doo:\n Lena Dupree from Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island is an... interesting variation. She\'s certainly cute, and she\'s certainly a monster, but her monster form itself? NOT. CUTE. They transform twice. The first form is just their normal human forms only with cat ears, teeth, eyes, claws and some fur. Then they transform into horrific monsters. The female zombies from the film are decidedly not cute as well.\n Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders has the cute native girl Shaggy had the hots for(!) -and who seemed to share his feelings(!!)- who was a real (benevolent) alien; she looked somewhat like a metallic-skinned Grey alien, but with an attractive human bodyshape and expressive facial features.\n The girls from Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School. They\'re all the daughters of famous monsters, Sibella for example is Dracula\'s daughter.\n Superman: The Animated Series depicts Mr Mxyzptlk as a short, bald, almost baby-like figure with a distinct slouch whereas his female "friend" (as he spends most of his time ignoring her, it\'s hard to say what their relationship is exactly), Ms Gsptlsnz is a normal-sized, or even tall, very curvy redhead with a penchant for 1950s-style clothes. Given that the residents of the 5th dimension can choose whatever appearance they want, this is almost certainly deliberate.\n Played with in Steven Universe: The series\'s "gems" are sentient rocks from outer space who project physical forms that resemble human women, usually with non-human skin and hair colors, while most fusions also possess multiple eyes and/or limbs. As opposed to most other examples on this page, gems take a wide variety of body shapes, not only conventionally attractive ones.\n Teen Titans:\n Kitten in the episode "Date with Destiny" looks like a cute, normal human girl. Her father, Killer Moth, appears to be some kind of moth man and her boyfriend, Fang, is a guy with a Giant Spider for a head (not a spider head, a spider). It turns out that Killer Moth is actually a regular guy in a costume, but despite the metallic voice and non-moving mouth you might not realize that just by watching the episode.\n Among the main characters there\'s Dark Magical Girl Raven, the daughter of an Eldritch Abomination Physical God and a human (well, Azarathian anyway) woman. Most of the time, she looks like a cute human girl, save for her pale skin and purple eyes and hair (and in their animesque world, it\'s hard to say just how unusual even some of those traits are). The angrier she gets, though, the more her father\'s monstrous traits start showing: when she has four glowing red eyes, an elongated body, and is spewing Lovecraftian amounts of darkness tendrils from her cloak, it\'s time to start running. Fast!\nDr. Light: It was so... so... dark... Make it stop... Make it stop...\n Beast Boy covers Cute Monster Boy, with his green skin, pointed ears, and Cute Little Fangs.\n In spite of Starfire\'s obvious beauty, Ms. Alien Eye-Candy still a superstrong alien monster with orange skin who shoots lasers. A really beautiful alien monster, but alien monster nonetheless. This is actually brought up whenever she decides to eat (her race eat giant insects and squids and have teeth filed down to points) or hug someone (accompanied by breaking-bone sounds).\n Transformers:\n The earliest female robots were indeed curvy and sexy, but more diverse female Transformer designs were been introduced, whether they were original characters, or new characters based on previously-male toys. However, "sexy" female Transformers are still the primary type.\n Dialogue, in the original series and Beast Wars, imply that sexual dimorphism is common amongst Cybertronians, Black Arachnia, Arcee and Thunderblast being a perfect example. Rat-Trap even mentions female stripper-bots with "enhanced chest-plates" or some such. The fact they even have strippers, to say nothing of cosmetic surgery, implies that our notions of gender roles are the same despite them being alien robots.\n For a particular aversion Strika. Yes, she is a girl. An earlier version of the character was even less feminine, and there was NO indication she was female when she first showed up; she pretended to have a beast-like mentality, only yelling wordlessly if she ever made any noise. When she spoke for the first time, well, huge surprise. Her earlier incarnation (a retcon naming an unnamed G1 Autobot as her) wasn\'t particularly shapely either, unless you count "box" as a shape.\n Transformers Animated has Sari, though she\'s less a \'monster\' than a half-Autobot.\n Miss Martian, from Young Justice, is a literal Green-Skinned Space Babe.  Only it turns out she\'s not; in an aversion, she\'s merely using her Voluntary Shapeshifting powers to pretend to be one, because her true form is not only ghastly-looking by human standards, it belongs to an oppressed minority race among her own species.\n Anytime one of the main characters of Totally Spies! is mutated into a half-human this is the guaranteed outcome. Even as a half-cockroach Alex still manages to be quite cute.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Other\xa0\n SF&F artists and illustrators love the concept. This may reflect the contents of the books they illustrate or not. Examples include (some NSFW due to naked breasts):\n Boris Vallejo.\n Fredrik K T Andersson.\n Julie Bell.\n Luis Royo.\n Rowena Morrill.\n\n\n', u'imagelink': u'http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Maestesized.jpg', u'doctype': u'trope', u'links': [{u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist', u'titleofwork': u'Blue Exorcist'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl', u'titleofwork': u'Daily Life with Monster Girl'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadlineSummonner', u'titleofwork': u'Deadline Summonner'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwelveBeast', u'titleofwork': u'12 Beast'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Demonbane', u'titleofwork': u'Demonbane'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan', u'titleofwork': u'DGray-Man'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon', u'titleofwork': u'Digimon'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier', u'titleofwork': u'Digimon Frontier'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure', u'titleofwork': u'Digimon Adventure'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DonDracula', u'titleofwork': u'Don Dracula'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf', u'titleofwork': u'Dragon Half'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara', u'titleofwork': u'Durarara!!'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied', u'titleofwork': u'Elfen Lied'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld', u'titleofwork': u'El-Hazard: The Magnificent World'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran', u'titleofwork': u'Franken Fran'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GeGeGeNoKitaro', u'titleofwork': u'GeGeGe no Kitaro'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoshuushouSamaNinomiyaKun', u'titleofwork': u'Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun'}, {u'genre': u'Anime and Manga', u'link': u'http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan', u'titleofwork': u'Haiyore!
